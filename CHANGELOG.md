## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **MCP detection bug in audit-scan.sh** (~60 lines modified)
  - **Root cause**: Script searched for `~/.claude/mcp.json` which doesn't exist
  - **Actual location**: Claude Code stores MCP config in `~/.claude.json` under `projects.<path>.mcpServers`
  - **Solution**: Multi-source detection with priority:
    1. `~/.claude.json` → `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` (most common)
    2. `./.claude/mcp.json` (project-level)
    3. `~/.claude/mcp.json` (legacy global)
  - JSON output now includes detailed `mcp` section (configured, count, servers, source)
  - Human output shows server count and source location
- **Bug `0\n0` in `claude_md_refs`** (~8 lines)
  - **Root cause**: `grep -c ... || echo "0"` could produce double output
  - **Solution**: Rewritten `count_pattern()` function to properly capture and return count

### Changed
- **audit-scan.sh** enhanced (~50 lines)
  - Added `MCP_SOURCE` variable to track where MCP config was found
  - Added `MCP_COUNT` variable for server count
  - Global `mcp.json` message changed from error to info (not required)
  - JSON output restructured with separate `mcp` object
- **claude-setup-audit-prompt.md** updated (~40 lines)
  - Phase 1.1: Now checks `~/.claude.json` instead of `~/.claude/mcp.json`
  - Phase 1.2: Complete MCP detection rewrite covering all 3 locations
  - Glossary: Updated MCP definition to explain config locations
  - Version: 2.8 → 2.9

### Stats
- 2 files modified (audit-scan.sh, claude-setup-audit-prompt.md)
- Bug impact: Scripts now correctly detect MCP servers (was showing "No MCP" even when configured)
- Tested: Verified on Méthode Aristote project with 9 MCP servers
