Major upgrade to the session search utility (`cs`) with new features and bug fixes.

#### New Features

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Multi-word AND search** | All words must match (was broken in v1) | `cs "prisma migration"` |
| **Project filter** | Filter by project name (substring) | `cs -p myproject "bug"` |

## [3.6.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed - Critical Factual Corrections

Major audit identifying and correcting factual errors that could mislead users about Claude Code's actual behavior.

#### 1. `--add-dir` Flag (Wrong Description → Permissions, Not Context Loading)

**Before**: Documented as "loading directories into context" / "focused context"
**Reality**: Grants tool access to directories outside CWD (permissions only, no token impact)

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | "focused context" → "allow tool access outside CWD" |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Add directory" → "Allow access outside CWD" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "limit loaded dirs" → "access dirs outside CWD" |
| quiz/questions/10-reference.yaml | Question + explanation corrected |

#### 2. `excludePatterns` → `permissions.deny` (Never Existed)

**Before**: Documented `excludePatterns` as a valid settings key
**Reality**: Never existed - the correct syntax is `permissions.deny`

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New syntax + warning |
| guide/data-privacy.md | New syntax + deprecation note |
| examples/scripts/audit-scan.sh | Detection + message fixed |
| tools/audit-prompt.md | 3 references corrected |

#### 3. `.claudeignore` Removed (Does Not Exist)

**Before**: Documented as a file exclusion mechanism like `.gitignore`
**Reality**: Not an official feature - use `permissions.deny` instead

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | References → `permissions.deny` |
| guide/data-privacy.md | Section removed |
| CHANGELOG.md:1244 | Historical reference corrected |

#### 4. "Selective Context Loading" Myth → Lazy Loading Reality

**Before**: Implied Claude loads entire codebase or selectively loads directories
**Reality**: Claude uses lazy loading - reads files on-demand via Read/Grep tools

| File | Correction |
|------|------------|
| guide/ultimate-guide.md | New section explaining lazy loading |
| guide/cheatsheet.md | "Giant context loads" → "Vague prompts" |
| machine-readable/reference.yaml | "load giant context" → "bloated CLAUDE.md" |

#### 5. Invented CLI Flags (SuperClaude Extension Confusion)

**Before**: `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink`, `--headless`, `--learn`, `--uc`, `--web` documented as official CLI flags
**Reality**: These are SuperClaude framework extensions (prompt injection), NOT official Claude Code flags

| Correction Type | Details |
|-----------------|---------|
| `--headless` | Replaced with `-p` (the actual flag for non-interactive mode) |
| `--think` variants | Clarified as "prompt keywords", not CLI flags |
| SuperClaude section | Added warning: "Non-official Extension" |
| Cheatsheet | Think flags table reformatted as prompt keywords |
| Decision tree | "Use --think" → "Use extended thinking prompts" |

#### 6. `@` File Reference Behavior

**Before**: "Claude loads file content automatically"
**After**: "Signals Claude to read files on-demand via tools"

### Added - Session Search Tool (`cs`)

**Problem solved**: After weeks of Claude Code usage, finding past conversations becomes painful:
- `claude --resume` is interactive (no search)
- Sessions accumulate in `~/.claude/projects/`
- No quick way to search "that session where I talked about auth"

**Solution**: `cs` — Zero-dependency bash script for searching and resuming sessions.

```bash
cs                    # List 10 recent sessions (15ms)
cs "authentication"   # Full-text search (400ms)
cs -n 20              # More results

# Output:
# 2026-01-15 08:32 │ my-project │ Implement OAuth flow for...
#   claude --resume 84287c0d-8778-4a8d-abf1-eb2807e327a8
```

**Performance comparison**:

| Tool | List | Search | Deps | Resume cmd |
|------|------|--------|------|------------|
| `cs` (this script) | 15ms | 400ms | None | ✅ Shown |
| claude-conversation-extractor | 230ms | 1.7s | Python | ❌ |
| `claude --resume` native | 500ms+ | ❌ | None | Interactive |

**Files created/modified**:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/scripts/session-search.sh` | Script in repo (source) |
| `examples/README.md` | Entry in Scripts table |
| `guide/observability.md` | Section "Session Search & Resume" |
| `guide/ultimate-guide.md:505-524` | Examples in "Finding session IDs" |
| `README.md:398-403` | Section "Utility Scripts" |
| `machine-readable/reference.yaml` | `deep_dive.session_search` entry |

**Installation** (local):
```bash
# Copy script
cp examples/scripts/session-search.sh ~/.claude/scripts/cs
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/cs

# Add alias to shell
echo 'alias cs="~/.claude/scripts/cs"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Added - Security Documentation

| File | Addition |
|------|----------|
| guide/security-hardening.md | Section 1.2 "Known Limitations of permissions.deny" |

**Content**:
- Blocking matrix (Read/Edit/Write/Bash)
- Security gaps documented (GitHub #4160)
- Recommended exhaustive config
- Defense-in-depth strategy

### Root Cause Analysis

The factual errors originated from:
1. **SuperClaude framework confusion**: User had `~/.claude/FLAGS.md` with custom flags that were documented as if official
2. **Assumption propagation**: "selective loading" concept was assumed from other AI tools
3. **Outdated syntax**: `excludePatterns` may have been planned but never implemented

## [2.9.0] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **MCP detection bug in audit-scan.sh** (~60 lines modified)
  - **Root cause**: Script searched for `~/.claude/mcp.json` which doesn't exist
  - **Actual location**: Claude Code stores MCP config in `~/.claude.json` under `projects.<path>.mcpServers`
  - **Solution**: Multi-source detection with priority:
    1. `~/.claude.json` → `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` (most common)
    2. `./.claude/mcp.json` (project-level)
    3. `~/.claude/mcp.json` (legacy global)
  - JSON output now includes detailed `mcp` section (configured, count, servers, source)
  - Human output shows server count and source location
- **Bug `0\n0` in `claude_md_refs`** (~8 lines)

  - **Solution**: Rewritten `count_pattern()` function to properly capture and return count

### Changed
- **audit-scan.sh** enhanced (~50 lines)
  - Added `MCP_SOURCE` variable to track where MCP config was found
  - Added `MCP_COUNT` variable for server count

  - Phase 1.2: Complete MCP detection rewrite covering all 3 locations
  - Glossary: Updated MCP definition to explain config locations
  - Version: 2.8 → 2.9

### Stats
