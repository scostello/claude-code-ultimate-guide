## 🚨 Active Critical Issues

### 1. GitHub Issue Auto-Creation in Wrong Repository (Dec 2025 - Present)

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - SECURITY/PRIVACY RISK**
**Status**: ⚠️ ACTIVE (as of Jan 28, 2026)
**Issue**: [#13797](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13797)
**First Reported**: December 12, 2025
**Affected Versions**: v2.0.65+

#### Problem

Claude Code **systematically creates GitHub issues in the public `anthropics/claude-code` repository** instead of the user's private repository, even when working within a local git repo directory.

#### Impact

**HIGH - PRIVACY/SECURITY**: At least **17+ confirmed cases** of users accidentally exposing sensitive information in the public repository:

- Database schemas
- API credentials and configuration details
- Infrastructure architecture
- Private project roadmaps
- Security configurations

#### Symptoms

- Issue created with unexpected `--repo anthropics/claude-code` flag
- Private project details appear in public anthropics/claude-code issues
- No confirmation prompt before creating issue in public repository
- Occurs when asking Claude to "create an issue" while in local git repo

#### Examples of Accidental Creations

Recent confirmed cases (Jan 2026):
- [#20792](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20792): "Deleted - created in wrong repo"
- [#16483](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16483), [#16476](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16476): "Claude OPENS ISSUES ON THE WRONG REPO"
- [#17899](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17899): "Claude Code suddenly decided to create issue in claude code repo"
- [#16464](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16464): "[Mistaken Post] Please delete"

Full list: [Search "wrong repo" OR "delete this"](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%22wrong+repo%22+OR+%22delete+this%22)

#### Root Cause (Hypothesis)

Claude Code may confuse:
- **Legitimate feedback** about Claude Code itself → `anthropics/claude-code` (correct)
- **User project issues** → Current repository (should be default)

The tool appears to hardcode or over-prioritize `anthropics/claude-code` as default target.

#### Workarounds

**🛡️ BEFORE creating any GitHub issue via Claude Code:**

1. **Always verify the target repository**:
   ```bash
   # Check current repo
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Explicitly specify repository**:
   ```bash
   gh issue create --repo YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO --title "..." --body "..."
   ```

3. **Review the command** before execution:
   - Look for `--repo anthropics/claude-code` flag
   - If present and incorrect, abort and specify correct repo

4. **Use manual approval** for all `gh` commands in Claude settings

5. **Never include sensitive information** in issue creation prompts until bug is fixed

#### If You're Affected

If you accidentally created an issue exposing sensitive information:

1. **Immediately contact GitHub Support** to request issue deletion (not just closing)
2. **Rotate any exposed credentials** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
3. **Report to Anthropic** via [security email](mailto:security@anthropic.com) if security-sensitive
4. **Check for data leaks**: Monitor exposed information usage

#### Official Response

As of Jan 28, 2026: **Issue remains open**, no official fix announced.

**Tracking**: [Issue #13797](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13797) (open since Dec 12, 2025)

### 2. Excessive Token Consumption (Jan 2026 - Present)

**Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH - COST IMPACT**
**Status**: ⚠️ REPORTED (Anthropic investigating)
**Issue**: [#16856](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16856)
**First Reported**: January 8, 2026
**Affected Versions**: v2.1.1+ (reported), may affect earlier versions

#### Problem

Multiple users report **4x+ faster token consumption** compared to previous versions, causing:
- Rate limits hit much faster than normal
- Same workflows consuming significantly more tokens
- Unexpected cost increases

#### Symptoms

From Issue #16856:
> "Starting from today's morning with the updated to CC 2.1.1 - the usage is ridiculous. I am working on the same projects for months, same routines, same time. But today it hits 5h limits like 4+ times faster!"

Common reports:
- Weekly limits exhausted in 1-2 days (vs. 5-7 days normally)
- Sessions hitting 90% context after 2-3 messages
- 4x-20x token consumption for identical operations

#### Context

**Holiday Usage Bonus Expiration**: December 25-31, 2025, Anthropic doubled usage limits as a holiday gift. When limits returned to normal on January 1, 2026, users experienced perception of "reduced capacity."

However, **reports persist beyond this timing**, suggesting potential underlying issue.

#### Anthropic Response

From [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/claude_devs_usage_limits/) (Jan 5, 2026):
> "Anthropic stated it 'takes all such reports seriously but hasn't identified any flaw related to token usage' and indicated it had ruled out bugs in its inference stack."

**Status**: **Not officially confirmed as a bug** by Anthropic as of Jan 28, 2026.

#### Related Issues

20+ reports found (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026):
- [#17687](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17687): "Unexpectedly high token consumption rate since January 2026"
- [#16073](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/16073): "[Critical] Claude Code Quality Degradation - Ignoring Instructions, Excessive Token Usage"
- [#17252](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17252): "Excessive token consumption rate in session usage tracking"
- [#13536](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13536): "Excessive token usage on new session initialization"

[Full search](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue+excessive+token+created%3A2025-12-01..2026-01-28)

#### Workarounds

While Anthropic investigates:

1. **Monitor token usage actively**:
   ```
   /context
   ```
   Check tokens used vs. capacity regularly

2. **Use shorter sessions**:
   - Restart sessions when approaching 50-60% context
   - Break complex tasks into multiple sessions

3. **Disable auto-compact** (may help):
   ```bash
   claude config set autoCompaction false
   ```

4. **Reduce MCP tools** if not needed:
   - Review `~/.claude/mcp.json`
   - Disable unused servers

5. **Use subagents** for isolated tasks:
   - Subagents have separate context windows
   - Use Task tool for complex operations

6. **Track your usage patterns**:
   - Compare before/after version upgrades
   - Document unusual spikes

#### Investigation Tips

If experiencing excessive consumption:

1. Note your **Claude Code version**: `claude --version`
2. **Compare versions**: Test with earlier stable version if available
3. **Document patterns**: Which operations trigger high usage?
4. **Report with data**: Include version, operation type, token counts in issue reports

## ✅ Resolved Historical Issues

### Model Quality Degradation (Aug-Sep 2025)

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** (mid-September 2025)
**Timeline**: August 25 - early September 2025

#### Problem

Users reported Claude Code producing:
- Worse outputs than previous versions
- Syntax errors unexpectedly
- Unexpected character insertions (Thai/Chinese text in English responses)
- Failed basic tasks
- Incorrect code edits

#### Root Cause

Anthropic identified **three infrastructure bugs** (not model degradation):

1. **Traffic Misrouting**: ~30% of Claude Code requests routed to wrong server type → degraded responses
2. **Output Corruption**: Misconfiguration deployed Aug 25 caused token generation errors
3. **XLA:TPU Miscompilation**: Performance optimization triggered latent compiler bug affecting token selection

#### Community Impact

- **Mass cancellation campaign** (Aug-Sep 2025)
- Community theories: intentional model degradation (quantization) to reduce costs
- Reddit sentiment dropped sharply

#### Anthropic Response

**Official Postmortem**: [A postmortem of three recent issues](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/a-postmortem-of-three-recent-issues) (Sept 17, 2025)

Key quote:
> "We never reduce model quality due to demand, time of day, or server load. The problems our users reported were due to infrastructure bugs alone."

**Resolution**: All bugs fixed by mid-September 2025.
