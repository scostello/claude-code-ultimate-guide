## The 15 Methodologies

Organized in a 6-tier pyramid from strategic orchestration down to optimization techniques.

### Tier 1: Strategic Orchestration

| Name | What | Best For | Claude Fit |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **BMAD** | Multi-agent governance with constitution as guardrail | Enterprise 10+ teams, long-term projects | ⭐⭐ Niche but powerful |
| **GSD** | Meta-prompting 6-phase workflow with fresh contexts per task | Solo devs, Claude Code CLI | ⭐⭐ Similar to patterns in guide |

**BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development)** inverts the traditional paradigm: documentation becomes the source of truth, not code. Uses specialized agents (Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, QA) orchestrated with strict governance.

- **Key concept**: Constitution.md as strategic guardrail
- **When to use**: Complex enterprise projects needing governance
- **When to avoid**: Small teams, MVPs, rapid prototyping

**GSD (Get Shit Done)** addresses context rot through systematic 6-phase workflow (Initialize → Discuss → Plan → Execute → Verify → Complete) with fresh 200k-token contexts per task. Core concepts (multi-agent orchestration, fresh context management) overlap significantly with existing patterns like Ralph Loop, Gas Town, and BMAD. See [resource evaluation](../claudedocs/resource-evaluations/gsd-evaluation.md) for detailed comparison.

> **Emerging**: [Ralph Inferno](https://github.com/sandstream/ralph-inferno) implements autonomous multi-persona workflows (Analyst→PM→UX→Architect→Business) with VM-based execution and self-correcting E2E loops. Experimental but interesting for "vibe coding at scale".

---

### Tier 2: Specification & Architecture

| Name | What | Best For | Claude Fit |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **SDD** | Specs before code | APIs, contracts | ⭐⭐⭐ Core pattern |
| **Doc-Driven** | Docs = source of truth | Cross-team alignment | ⭐⭐⭐ CLAUDE.md native |
| **Req-Driven** | Rich artifact context (20+ artifacts) | Complex requirements | ⭐⭐ Heavy setup |
| **DDD** | Domain language first | Business logic | ⭐⭐ Design-time |

**SDD (Spec-Driven Development)** — Specifications BEFORE code. One well-structured iteration equals 8 unstructured ones. CLAUDE.md IS your spec file.

**Doc-Driven Development** — Living documentation versioned in git becomes the single source of truth. Changes to specs trigger implementation.

**Requirements-Driven Development** — Uses CLAUDE.md as comprehensive implementation guide with 20+ structured artifacts.

**DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** — Aligns software with business language through:
- Ubiquitous Language: Shared vocabulary in code
- Bounded Contexts: Isolated domain boundaries
- Domain Distillation: Core vs Support vs Generic domains

---

### Tier 3: Behavior & Acceptance

| Name | What | Best For | Claude Fit |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **BDD** | Given-When-Then scenarios | Stakeholder collaboration | ⭐⭐⭐ Tests & specs |
| **ATDD** | Acceptance criteria first | Compliance, regulated | ⭐⭐ Process-heavy |
| **CDD** | API contracts as interface | Microservices | ⭐⭐⭐ OpenAPI native |

**BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** — Beyond testing: a collaboration process.
1. Discovery: Involve devs and business experts
2. Formulation: Write Given-When-Then examples
3. Automation: Convert to executable tests (Gherkin/Cucumber)

```gherkin
Feature: Order Management
  Scenario: Cannot buy without stock
    Given product with 0 stock
    When customer attempts purchase
    Then system refuses with error message
```

**ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development)** — Acceptance criteria defined BEFORE coding, collaboratively ("Three Amigos": Business, Dev, Test).

**CDD (Contract-Driven Development)** — API contracts (OpenAPI specs) as executable interface between teams. Patterns: Contract as Test, Contract as Stub.

---

### Tier 4: Feature Delivery

| Name | What | Best For | Claude Fit |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **FDD** | Feature-by-feature delivery | Large teams 10+ | ⭐⭐ Structure |
| **Context Eng.** | Context as first-class design | Long sessions | ⭐⭐⭐ Fundamental |

**FDD (Feature-Driven Development)** — Five processes:
1. Develop Overall Model
2. Build Features List
3. Plan by Feature
4. Design by Feature
5. Build by Feature

Strict iteration: 2 weeks max per feature.

**Context Engineering** — Treat context as design element:
- Progressive Disclosure: Let agent discover incrementally
- Memory Management: Conversation vs persistent memory
- Dynamic Refresh: Rewrite TODO list before response

---

### Tier 5: Implementation

| Name | What | Best For | Claude Fit |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **TDD** | Red-Green-Refactor | Quality code | ⭐⭐⭐ Core workflow |
| **Eval-Driven** | Evals for LLM outputs | AI products | ⭐⭐⭐ Agents |
| **Multi-Agent** | Orchestrate sub-agents | Complex tasks | ⭐⭐⭐ Task tool |

**TDD (Test-Driven Development)** — The classic cycle:
1. **Red**: Write failing test
2. **Green**: Minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up, tests stay green

With Claude: Be explicit. "Write FAILING tests that don't exist yet."

> **Verification Loops** — A formalized pattern for autonomous iteration:
>
> Use testing as termination condition:
> 1. Claude writes tests for the feature
> 2. Claude iterates code until tests pass
> 3. Continue until explicit completion criteria met
>
> **Official guidance**: *"Tell Claude to keep going until all tests pass. It will usually take a few iterations."* — [Anthropic Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
>
> Implementation: Can be enforced via Stop hooks, multi-Claude verification, or explicit "DONE" markers in prompts.

**Eval-Driven Development** — TDD for LLMs. Test agent behaviors via evals:
- Code-based: `output == golden_answer`
- LLM-based: Another Claude evaluates
- Human grading: Reference, slow

> **Eval Harness** — The infrastructure that runs evaluations end-to-end: providing instructions and tools, running tasks concurrently, recording steps, grading outputs, and aggregating results.
>
> See Anthropic's comprehensive guide: [Demystifying Evals for AI Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/demystifying-evals-for-ai-agents)

**Multi-Agent Orchestration** — From single assistant to orchestrated team:
```
Meta-Agent (Orchestrator)
├── Analyst (requirements)
├── Architect (design)
├── Developer (code)
└── Reviewer (validation)
```

---

### Tier 6: Optimization

| Name | What | Best For | Claude Fit |
|------|------|----------|------------|
| **Iterative Loops** | Autonomous refinement | Optimization | ⭐⭐⭐ Core |
| **Fresh Context** | Reset per task, state in files | Long autonomous sessions | ⭐⭐⭐ Power users |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Technique foundation | Everything | ⭐⭐⭐ Prerequisite |

**Iterative Refinement Loops** — Autonomous convergence:
1. Execute prompt
2. Observe result
3. If result ≠ "DONE" → refine and repeat

**Prompt Engineering** — Foundations for ALL Claude usage:
- Zero-Shot Chain of Thought: "Think step by step"
- Few-Shot Learning: 2-3 examples of expected pattern
- Structured Prompts: XML tags for organization
- Position Matters: For long docs, place question at end

**Fresh Context Pattern (Ralph Loop)** — Solves context rot by spawning fresh agent instances per task. State persists in git + progress files, not chat history. Ideal for long autonomous sessions (migrations, overnight runs). See [Ultimate Guide - Fresh Context Pattern](./ultimate-guide.md#fresh-context-pattern-ralph-loop) for implementation.

## SDD Tools Reference

Three tools have emerged to formalize Spec-Driven Development:

| Tool | Use Case | Official Docs | Claude Integration |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Spec Kit** | Greenfield, governance | [github.blog/spec-kit](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/) | `/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan` |
| **OpenSpec** | Brownfield, changes | [github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) | `/openspec:proposal`, `/openspec:apply`, `/openspec:archive` |
| **Specmatic** | API contract testing | [specmatic.io](https://specmatic.io) | MCP agent available |

### Spec Kit (Greenfield)

5-phase workflow:
1. Constitution: `/speckit.constitution` → guardrails
2. Specify: `/speckit.specify` → requirements
3. Plan: `/speckit.plan` → architecture
4. Tasks: `/speckit.tasks` → decomposition
5. Implement: `/speckit.implement` → code

### OpenSpec (Brownfield)

Two-folder architecture:
```
openspec/
├── specs/      ← Current truth (stable)
└── changes/    ← Proposals (temporary)
```

Workflow: Proposal → Review → Apply → Archive

### Specmatic (API Contracts)

- **Contract as Test**: Auto-generates 1000s of tests from OpenAPI spec
- **Contract as Stub**: Mock server for parallel development
- **Backward Compatibility**: Detects breaking changes

## Writing Effective Specs

> Based on analysis of 2,500+ agent configuration files.
> Source: [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-spec/)

### The Six Essential Components

| Component | What to Include | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Commands** | Executable with flags | `npm test -- --coverage` |
| **Testing** | Framework, coverage, locations | `vitest, 80%, tests/` |
| **Project structure** | Explicit directories | `src/`, `lib/`, `tests/` |
| **Code style** | One example > paragraphs | Show a real function |
| **Git workflow** | Branch, commit, PR format | `feat/name`, conventional commits |
| **Boundaries** | Permission tiers | See below |

### Permission Tiers

| Tier | Symbol | Use For |
|------|--------|---------|
| Always do | ✅ | Safe actions, no approval (lint, format) |
| Ask first | ⚠️ | High-impact changes (delete, publish) |
| Never do | 🚫 | Hard stops (commit secrets, force push main) |

### Curse of Instructions

> ⚠️ Research shows **more instructions = worse adherence** to each one.
>
> Solution: Feed only relevant spec sections per task, not the entire document.

### Monolithic vs Modular Specs

| Project Size | Approach |
|--------------|----------|
| Small (<10 files) | Single spec file |
| Medium (10-50 files) | Sectioned spec, feed per task |
| Large (50+ files) | Sub-agent routing by domain |

---

## Combination Patterns

Recommended stacks by situation:

| Situation | Recommended Stack | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Solo MVP | SDD + TDD | Minimal overhead, quality focus |
| Team 5-10, greenfield | Spec Kit + TDD + BDD | Governance + quality + collaboration |
| Microservices | CDD + Specmatic | Contract-first, parallel dev |
| Existing SaaS (100+ features) | OpenSpec + BDD | Change tracking, no spec drift |
| Enterprise 10+ | BMAD + Spec Kit + Specmatic | Full governance + contracts |
| LLM-native product | Eval-Driven + Multi-Agent | Self-improving systems |
