## 🎯 Development Workflows

### [Plan-Driven Development](./plan-driven.md)

Structure complex tasks with planning mode before execution.

**When to use**: Multi-step features, architectural changes, uncertainty about approach

### [TDD with Claude](./tdd-with-claude.md)

Test-Driven Development workflow: write tests first, implement after.

**When to use**: Critical functionality, regression prevention, API design

### [Spec-First Development](./spec-first.md)

Write specifications before code for better requirements clarity.

**When to use**: Team collaboration, complex features, documentation-first projects

### [Iterative Refinement](./iterative-refinement.md)

Improve code through multiple refinement cycles.

**When to use**: Quality improvements, performance optimization, code cleanup

---

## 🎨 Design & Content

### [Design to Code](./design-to-code.md)

Convert design mockups (Figma, wireframes) into working code.

**When to use**: Frontend development, UI implementation, design system work

### [PDF Generation](./pdf-generation.md)

Generate professional PDFs using Quarto/Typst with Claude Code.

**When to use**: Reports, documentation, whitepapers, technical documents

### [TTS Setup](./tts-setup.md)

Configure Text-to-Speech for Claude Code responses (Agent Vibes integration).

**When to use**: Audio feedback, accessibility, hands-free coding

---

## 🔬 Code Exploration

### [Exploration Workflow](./exploration-workflow.md)

Systematically explore and understand unfamiliar codebases.

**When to use**: New projects, legacy code, documentation gaps

**Related**: See [Search Tools Mastery](./search-tools-mastery.md) for advanced multi-tool exploration strategies.
