## TL;DR

```
1. Initial prompt with clear goal
2. Claude produces output
3. Evaluate against criteria
4. Specific feedback: "Change X because Y"
5. Repeat until done
```

Key insight: **Specific feedback > vague feedback**

## The Loop

### Step 1: Initial Prompt

Start with clear intent and constraints:

```
Create a React component for a user profile card.
- Show avatar, name, bio
- Include edit button
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-responsive
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Output

Claude produces code. Evaluate:
- Does it meet requirements?
- What's missing?
- What's wrong?
- What could be better?

### Step 3: Specific Feedback

Provide targeted corrections:

```
Good start. Changes needed:
1. Avatar should be circular, not square
2. Edit button should only show for own profile (add isOwner prop)
3. Bio should truncate after 3 lines with "Show more"
```

### Step 4: Repeat

Continue until satisfied:

```
Better. One more thing:
- Add loading skeleton state for when data is fetching
```

## Feedback Patterns

### Effective Feedback

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Specific location** | "Line 23: change `===` to `==`" |
| **Clear action** | "Add error boundary around the form" |
| **Reason given** | "Remove the console.log because it leaks user data" |
| **Priority marked** | "Critical: fix the SQL injection. Nice-to-have: add pagination." |

### Ineffective Feedback

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Alternative |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| "Make it better" | No direction | "Improve readability by extracting the validation logic" |
| "This is wrong" | No specifics | "The date format should be ISO 8601, not Unix timestamp" |
| "I don't like it" | Subjective | "Use functional components instead of class components" |
| "Fix the bugs" | Too vague | "Fix: 1) null check on line 12, 2) off-by-one in loop" |

## Autonomous Loops

Claude can self-iterate with clear completion criteria.

### The Ralph Wiggum Pattern

Named after the self-improvement loop pattern:

```
Keep improving the code quality until:
1. All tests pass
2. No TypeScript errors
3. ESLint shows zero warnings

After each iteration, run the checks and fix any issues.
Stop when all criteria are met.
```

### Completion Criteria Examples

```
Iterate until:
- Response time < 100ms for 95th percentile
- Test coverage > 80%
- All accessibility checks pass
- Bundle size < 200KB
```

### Iteration Limits

Always set limits to prevent infinite loops:

```
Improve the algorithm performance.
Maximum 5 iterations.
Stop early if improvement < 5% between iterations.
```

## Integration with Claude Code

### With TodoWrite

Track refinement iterations:

```
TodoWrite:
- [x] Initial implementation
- [x] Fix: handle empty arrays
- [x] Fix: add input validation
- [ ] Optimization: memoize expensive calculations
```

### With Hooks

Auto-validate after each change:

```yaml
# .claude/hooks.yaml
post_edit:
  - command: "npm run lint && npm test"
    on_failure: "report"
```

Claude sees failures and can self-correct.

### With /compact

When context grows during iterations:

```
/compact

Continue refining the search algorithm.
We've made good progress, focus on the remaining issues.
```

### Checkpointing

After significant progress:

```
Good progress. Let's checkpoint:
- Commit what we have
- List remaining issues
- Continue with the next priority
```

---

## Iteration Strategies

### Breadth-First

Fix all issues at same level before going deeper:

```
First pass: Fix all type errors
Second pass: Fix all lint warnings
Third pass: Improve test coverage
Fourth pass: Optimize performance
```

### Depth-First

Complete one area fully before moving on:

```
1. Perfect the authentication flow (all aspects)
2. Then move to user management
3. Then move to settings
```

### Priority-Based

Address by importance:

```
Iterate in this order:
1. Security issues (critical)
2. Data integrity bugs (high)
3. UX problems (medium)
4. Code style (low)
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Moving Target

```
# Wrong
"Actually, let's change the approach entirely..."
(Repeated 5 times)

# Right
Commit to an approach, iterate within it.
If approach is wrong, explicitly restart.
```

### Perfectionism Loop

```
# Wrong
Keep improving forever

# Right
Set clear "good enough" criteria:
- Tests pass
- Handles main use cases
- No critical issues
→ Ship it, improve later
```

### Lost Context

```
# Wrong
After 50 iterations, forget what the goal was

# Right
Periodically restate the goal:
"Reminder: we're building a rate limiter.
Current state: basic implementation works.
Next: add Redis backend."
```

## Example Session

### Initial Request
```
Create a debounce function in TypeScript.
```

### Iteration 1
```
Looks good. Add:
- Generic type support for any function signature
- Option to execute on leading edge
```

### Iteration 2
```
Better. Issues:
- The return type should preserve the original function's return type
- Add cancellation support
```

### Iteration 3
```
Almost there. Final polish:
- Add JSDoc comments
- Export the types separately
- Add unit tests
```

### Completion
```
Perfect. Commit this as "feat: add debounce utility with full TypeScript support"
```
