## Security Summary

No official security documentation exists yet. Essential practices:

1. **Dedicated workspace** — Never grant access to Documents/Desktop
2. **Review plans** — Check every action before approval
3. **No credentials** — Keep sensitive data out of workspace
4. **Backup first** — Before destructive operations
