## Unique Learnings to Extract

### 1. mgrep Tool (Token Optimization)
- 50% token reduction vs grep/ripgrep
- Implementation details to document
- Comparison benchmarks to validate

### 2. pass@k and pass^k Metrics
- Formal verification approach:
  - pass@k: At least one of k attempts succeeds
  - pass^k: All k attempts must succeed
  - Example: k=3 → 91% pass@k, 34% pass^k
- Application: Measure skill effectiveness empirically

### 3. Hookify Plugin Workflow
- Conversational hook creation (describe need → JSON generated)
- Lowers barrier vs manual JSON writing
- Pattern: Natural language → structured config

### 4. Sandboxed Subagents
- Tool restriction per agent (security-reviewer can't Edit)
- Prevents accidental destructive actions
- Implementation: Define `tools: [Read, Grep]` in agent config

### 5. Cascade Method (Multi-Instance)
- Manage multiple Claude instances: "Sweep left to right, oldest to newest"
- Focus on 3-4 tasks max
- Prevents context switching overhead

### 6. Stop Hook Pattern
- Auto-summarization at session end (vs per-message)
- Captures: successes, failures, unexplored paths
- Feeds into reusable skills

### 7. Skill Creator from Git History
- Extract patterns from actual commits
- Plugin or local implementation
- Pattern: `git log` → skill definition

### 8. Context-Aware MCP Management
- 20-30 MCPs configured, <10 enabled per project
- Reduces context window pressure (200k → 70k effective)
- Strategy: Enable per task, not globally

### 9. Iterative Retrieval Pattern
- 3-cycle max for subagent context clarification
- Corrects subagent limitation (lack of orchestrator context)
- Flow: Query → Clarify → Revisit → Output

### 10. Two-Instance Kickoff Pattern
- Instance 1 (Scaffolding): Project structure + config
- Instance 2 (Research): Deep integration + docs
- Prevents context mixing early in project

- **Impact**: Medium (requires adaptation)

### 2. Node.js Dependency
- **Risk**: Not all teams use Node.js
- **Mitigation**: Manual installation available (bash-compatible)
- **Impact**: Low (Node.js widely adopted)

### 3. Learning Curve
- **Risk**: Advanced patterns assume Claude Code familiarity
- **Mitigation**: Shortform guide covers foundations
- **Impact**: Medium (our guide bridges this gap)

### 4. Plugin System Maturity
- **Risk**: New distribution model, potential bugs
- **Mitigation**: Manual installation fallback
- **Impact**: Low (community testing rapid)

### 5. Maintenance Dependence
- **Risk**: Single primary author (affaan-m)
- **Mitigation**: 3.8k forks ensure continuity, MIT license
- **Impact**: Low (community can fork-maintain)
