## Done

### MCP Security Hardening ✅
Unified security research covering MCP vulnerabilities, prompt injection, and secret detection.

**Completed**: [Security Hardening Guide](./guide/security-hardening.md) covers:
- CVE-2025-53109/53110, 54135, 54136 with mitigations
- MCP vetting workflow with 5-minute audit checklist
- MCP Safe List (community vetted)
- Prompt injection evasion techniques (Unicode, ANSI, null bytes)
- Secret detection tool comparison (Gitleaks, TruffleHog, GitGuardian)
- Incident response procedures (secret exposed, MCP compromised)
- 3 new hooks: `unicode-injection-scanner.sh`, `repo-integrity-scanner.sh`, `mcp-config-integrity.sh`

## Watching (Waiting for Demand)

### Multi-LLM Consultation Patterns
Using external LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4) as "second opinion" from Claude Code.

**Status:** No proven demand. Add if 3+ reader requests.

**Research done (Jan 2026):**
- Simple approach: Bash script calling Gemini API
- Production approach: [Plano](https://github.com/katanemo/plano) (overkill for solo devs)
- Community adoption: Near zero in Claude Code users

**If implementing:**
- `examples/scripts/gemini-second-opinion.sh`
- 3-line mention in "See Also" section
- No full guide (maintenance burden, scope creep)

### Vibe Coding Discourse

Evolution of the "developer as architect" narrative in AI-assisted development.

**Reference:** [Craig Adam - "Agile is Out, Architecture is Back"](https://medium.com/@craig_32726/agile-is-out-architecture-is-back-7586910ab810)

**Status:** Watching. Term "vibe coding" now mainstream (Collins Word of the Year 2025).

## Discarded Ideas

| Idea | Reason Discarded |
|------|------------------|
| LLM Fine-tuning guide | Out of scope - users don't control model training |
| Model architecture internals | Too theoretical, not actionable |
| Token pricing optimization | Changes too frequently, use official docs |
| A2A Protocol (Agent-to-Agent) | Claude Code is single-agent with sub-agents, not true multi-agent |
| AgentOps Enterprise Dashboard | Infrastructure doesn't exist for CLI tool |
| LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation | Overkill for CLI, adds latency without proportional value |
| Decision Trajectory logging | No access to internal traces (black box) |
| 4 Pillars formal framework | Too academic - guide already covers symptoms pragmatically |
| Canary/Blue-Green deployments | Infrastructure patterns, not relevant for CLI |
| Memory Poisoning defenses | Theoretical risk requiring prior system compromise |
| Prompt Engineering for Code Gen | Already well covered (xml_prompting, prompt_formula) |
| Context Window Optimization | Already well covered (context_management, context_triage) |
| Task Decomposition Patterns | Covered via plan_mode, interaction_loop |
| Agent Architecture Comparisons | Out of scope - not multi-agent theory |
| Real-World Case Studies | Non-verifiable metrics, marketing-prone |
| Comparison with Other Tools | Out of scope, rapid obsolescence |
