## Communication Style

- Terminal: iTerm2 / Windows Terminal
- Version control: Git

## Workflow Preferences

### When Writing Code
- Always include type definitions
- Add error handling
- Write tests for critical paths
- Use async/await over callbacks

### When Reviewing
- Focus on logic and security first
- Style suggestions are secondary
- Point out potential edge cases

### When Debugging
- Show me the investigation process
- Explain your reasoning
- Suggest multiple solutions if applicable

## Common Shortcuts
