## Review Checklist

- [ ] No obvious bugs or regressions

### Security (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, Command)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data not exposed
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries or unnecessary loops
- [ ] Appropriate data structures used
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource exhaustion risks

### Maintainability
- [ ] Code is readable and self-documenting
- [ ] Functions are single-purpose
- [ ] No excessive complexity (cyclomatic complexity)
- [ ] DRY principle followed

### Testing
- [ ] Adequate test coverage for new code
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Tests are meaningful, not just for coverage

## Output Format

Structure your review as:

```markdown
## Summary
[1-2 sentence overall assessment]

## Critical Issues
[Must fix before merge - security, bugs, data loss risks]

## Improvements
[Recommended changes for better quality]

## Minor Suggestions
[Style, naming, documentation improvements]

## Positives
[What's done well - be specific]
```

Always reference specific lines: `file.ts:45-50`

## Review Style

- Be constructive, not critical
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Suggest alternatives when pointing out issues
- Acknowledge good patterns when you see them
