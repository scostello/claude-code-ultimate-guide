|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| CRITICAL | ... | file:line | ... |

### High-Risk Issues
[Fix before production]

### Medium-Risk Issues
[Address in next sprint]

### Recommendations
[Best practice improvements]

### Compliant Areas
[What's done well]

## Common Patterns to Check

```javascript
// BAD: SQL Injection
query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`

// GOOD: Parameterized
query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1`, [userId]

// BAD: XSS vulnerable
element.innerHTML = userInput

// GOOD: Safe
element.textContent = userInput

// BAD: Hardcoded secret
const API_KEY = "sk-abc123..."

// GOOD: Environment variable
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY
```
