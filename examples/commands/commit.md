# Conventional Commit

Generate a conventional commit message for staged changes.

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
2. Analyze the nature of changes
3. Generate a commit message following the format below

## Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes nor adds feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Rules
- Subject: imperative mood, no period, max 50 chars
- Body: explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Footer: breaking changes, issue references

## Examples

```

Users can now request a reset link and set new password.

```

```

This fixes duplicate charge issues reported by users.

Fixes #456
```

```

```

## Execution

Ask for confirmation before executing `git commit -m "..."`.
