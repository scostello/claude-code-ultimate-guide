## TL;DR - The 5-Minute Summary

If you only have 5 minutes, here's what you need to know:

### Essential Commands
```bash
claude                    # Start Claude Code
/help                     # Show all commands
/status                   # Check context usage
/compact                  # Compress context when >70%
/clear                    # Fresh start
/plan                     # Safe read-only mode
Ctrl+C                    # Cancel operation
```

### The Workflow
```
Describe → Claude Analyzes → Review Diff → Accept/Reject → Verify
```

### Context Management (Critical!)
| Context % | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-50% | Work freely |
| 50-70% | Be selective |
| 70-90% | `/compact` now |
| 90%+ | `/clear` required |

### Memory Hierarchy
```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md       → Global (all projects)
/project/CLAUDE.md        → Project (committed)
/project/.claude/         → Personal (not committed)
```

### Power Features
| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Agents** | Specialized AI personas for specific tasks |
| **Skills** | Reusable knowledge modules |
| **Hooks** | Automation scripts triggered by events |
| **MCP Servers** | External tools (Serena, Context7, Playwright...) |

### The Golden Rules
1. **Always review diffs** before accepting changes
2. **Use `/compact`** before context gets critical
3. **Be specific** in your requests (WHAT, WHERE, HOW, VERIFY)
4. **Start with Plan Mode** for complex/risky tasks
5. **Create CLAUDE.md** for every project

### Quick Decision Tree
```
Simple task → Just ask Claude
Complex task → Use TodoWrite to plan
Risky change → Enter Plan Mode first
Repeating task → Create an agent or command
Context full → /compact or /clear
```

# 1. Quick Start (Day 1)

**Reading time**: 15 minutes

**Skill level**: Beginner

**Goal**: Go from zero to productive

## 1.1 Installation

Choose your preferred installation method based on your operating system:

### Option A: npm (Recommended - All Platforms)

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This method works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

### Option B: Shell Script (macOS/Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### Option C: Homebrew (macOS only)

```bash
brew install claude-code
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
claude --version
```

### Platform-Specific Paths

| Platform | Global Config Path | Shell Config |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **macOS/Linux** | `~/.claude/` | `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` |
| **Windows** | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\` | PowerShell profile |

> **Windows Users**: Throughout this guide, when you see `~/.claude/`, use `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\` or `C:\Users\YourName\.claude\` instead.

### First Launch

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

On first launch:

1. You'll be prompted to authenticate with your Anthropic account
2. Accept the terms of service
3. Claude Code will index your project (may take a few seconds for large codebases)

## 1.2 First Workflow

Let's fix a bug together. This demonstrates the core interaction loop.

### Step 1: Describe the Problem

```
You: There's a bug in the login function - users can't log in with email addresses containing a plus sign
```

### Step 2: Claude Analyzes

Claude will:
- Search your codebase for relevant files
- Read the login-related code
- Identify the issue
- Propose a fix

### Step 3: Review the Diff

```diff
- const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
+ const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/;
```

💡 **Critical**: Always read the diff before accepting. This is your safety net.

### Step 4: Accept or Reject

- Press `y` to accept the change
- Press `n` to reject and ask for alternatives
- Press `e` to edit the change manually

### Step 5: Verify

```
You: Run the tests to make sure this works
```

Claude will run your test suite and report results.

### Step 6: Commit (Optional)

```
You: Commit this fix
```

Claude will create a commit with an appropriate message.

## 1.3 Essential Commands

These 7 commands cover 90% of daily usage:

| Command | Action | When to Use |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show all commands | When you're lost |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation | Start fresh |
| `/compact` | Summarize context | Running low on context |
| `/status` | Show session info | Check context usage |
| `/exit` or `Ctrl+D` | Exit Claude Code | Done working |
| `/plan` | Enter Plan Mode | Safe exploration |
| `/rewind` | Undo changes | Made a mistake |

### Quick Actions

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `!command` | Run shell command directly |
| `@file.ts` | Reference a specific file |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation |
| `Ctrl+R` | Retry last operation |
| `Esc` | Dismiss current suggestion |

## 1.4 Permission Modes

Claude Code has three permission modes that control how much autonomy Claude has:

### Default Mode

Claude asks permission before:
- Editing files
- Running commands
- Making commits

This is the safest mode for learning.

### Auto-accept Mode

```
You: Turn on auto-accept for the rest of this session
```

Claude will execute changes without asking. Use when you trust the operation and want speed.

⚠️ **Warning**: Only use auto-accept for well-defined, reversible operations.

### Plan Mode

```
/plan
```

Claude can only read and analyze - no modifications allowed. Perfect for:
- Understanding unfamiliar code
- Exploring architectural options
- Safe investigation before changes

Exit with `/execute` when ready to make changes.

## 1.5 Productivity Checklist

You're ready for Day 2 when you can:

- [ ] Launch Claude Code in your project
- [ ] Describe a task and review the proposed changes
- [ ] Accept or reject changes after reading the diff
- [ ] Run a shell command with `!`
- [ ] Reference a file with `@`
- [ ] Use `/clear` to start fresh
- [ ] Use `/status` to check context usage
- [ ] Exit cleanly with `/exit` or `Ctrl+D`

## 1.6 Migrating from Other AI Coding Tools

Switching from GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or other AI assistants? Here's what you need to know.

### Why Claude Code is Different

| Feature | GitHub Copilot | Cursor | Claude Code |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **Interaction** | Inline autocomplete | Chat + autocomplete | CLI + conversation |
| **Context** | Current file | Open files | Entire project |
| **Autonomy** | Suggestions only | Edit + chat | Full task execution |
| **Customization** | Limited | Extensions | Agents, skills, hooks, MCP |
| **Cost Model** | $10-20/month flat | $20/month flat | Pay-per-use ($0.10-$0.50/hour) |

**Key mindset shift**: Claude Code is a **conversational coding partner**, not an autocomplete tool.

### Migration Guide: GitHub Copilot → Claude Code

#### What Copilot Does Well

- **Inline suggestions** - Fast autocomplete as you type
- **Familiar workflow** - Works inside your editor
- **Low friction** - No context switching

#### What Claude Code Does Better

- **Multi-file refactoring** - Copilot: one file at a time | Claude: entire codebase
- **Complex tasks** - Copilot: suggests lines | Claude: implements features
- **Understanding context** - Copilot: current file | Claude: project-wide awareness
- **Explaining code** - Copilot: limited | Claude: detailed explanations
- **Debugging** - Copilot: weak | Claude: systematic root cause analysis

#### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Use Copilot for:**
- Quick autocomplete while typing
- Boilerplate code generation
- Simple function completions

**Use Claude Code for:**
- Feature implementation (multi-file changes)
- Debugging complex issues
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Writing tests for entire modules

**Workflow example**:

```bash
# Morning: Plan feature with Claude Code
claude
You: "I need to add user authentication. What's the best approach for this codebase?"
# Claude analyzes project, suggests architecture

# During coding: Use Copilot for inline completions
# Type in VS Code, Copilot autocompletes

# Afternoon: Debug with Claude Code
claude
You: "Login fails on mobile but works on desktop. Debug this."
# Claude systematically investigates

# End of day: Review with Claude Code
claude
You: "Review my changes today. Check for security issues."
# Claude reviews all modified files
```

### Migration Guide: Cursor → Claude Code

#### What Cursor Does Well

- **Inline editing** - Direct code modifications in editor
- **GUI interface** - Familiar VS Code experience
- **Chat + autocomplete** - Both modalities in one tool

#### What Claude Code Does Better

- **Terminal-native workflow** - Better for CLI-heavy developers
- **Advanced customization** - Agents, skills, hooks, commands
- **MCP servers** - Extensibility beyond what Cursor offers
- **Cost efficiency** - Pay for what you use vs. flat $20/month
- **Git integration** - Native git operations, commit generation
- **CI/CD integration** - Headless mode for automation

#### When to Switch

**Stick with Cursor if:**
- You strongly prefer GUI over CLI
- You want all-in-one IDE experience
- You use it >4 hours/day (flat rate is better)
- You don't need advanced customization

**Switch to Claude Code if:**
- You're comfortable with terminal workflows
- You want deeper customization (agents, hooks)
- You work with complex, multi-repo projects
- You want to integrate AI into CI/CD
- You prefer pay-per-use pricing

#### Running Both

You can use both tools simultaneously:

```bash
# Cursor for editing and quick changes
# Claude Code in terminal for complex tasks

# Example workflow:
# 1. Use Cursor to explore and make quick edits
# 2. Open terminal: claude
# 3. Ask Claude Code: "Review my changes and suggest improvements"
# 4. Apply suggestions in Cursor
# 5. Use Claude Code to generate tests
```

### Migration Checklist

#### Week 1: Learning Phase

```markdown
□ Complete Quick Start (Section 1)
□ Understand context management (critical!)
□ Try 3-5 small tasks (bug fixes, small features)
□ Learn when to use /plan mode
□ Practice reviewing diffs before accepting
```

#### Week 2: Establishing Workflow

```markdown
□ Create project CLAUDE.md file
□ Set up 1-2 custom commands for frequent tasks
□ Configure MCP servers (Serena, Context7)
□ Define your hybrid workflow (when to use Claude Code vs. other tools)
□ Track costs and optimize based on usage
```

#### Week 3-4: Advanced Usage

```markdown
□ Create custom agents for specialized tasks
□ Set up hooks for automation (formatting, linting)
□ Integrate into CI/CD if applicable
□ Build team patterns if working with others
□ Refine CLAUDE.md based on learnings
```

### Common Migration Issues

**Issue 1: "I miss inline suggestions"**

- **Solution**: Keep using Copilot/Cursor for autocomplete, use Claude Code for complex tasks
- **Alternative**: Request Claude to generate code snippets you can paste

**Issue 2: "Context switching is annoying"**

- **Solution**: Use split terminal (editor on left, Claude Code on right)
- **Tip**: Set up keyboard shortcut to toggle terminal focus

**Issue 3: "I don't know when to use which tool"**

- **Rule of thumb**:
  - **<5 lines of code** → Use Copilot/autocomplete
  - **5-50 lines, single file** → Either tool works
  - **>50 lines or multi-file** → Use Claude Code

**Issue 4: "Claude Code is slower than autocomplete"**

- **Reality check**: Claude Code solves different problems
- **Don't compare**: Autocomplete vs. full task execution
- **Optimize**: Use specific queries, manage context well

**Issue 5: "Costs are unpredictable"**

- **Solution**: Track costs in Anthropic Console
- **Budget**: Set mental budget per session ($0.10-$0.50)
- **Optimize**: Use `/compact`, be specific in queries

### Transition Strategies

**Strategy 1: Gradual (Recommended)**

```
Week 1: Use Claude Code 1-2 times/day for specific tasks
Week 2: Use Claude Code for all debugging and reviews
Week 3: Use Claude Code for feature implementation
Week 4: Full workflow integration
```

**Strategy 2: Cold Turkey**

```
Day 1: Disable Copilot/Cursor, force yourself to use only Claude Code
Day 2-3: Frustration period (learning curve)
Day 4-7: Productivity recovery
Week 2+: Full proficiency
```

**Strategy 3: Task-Based**

```
Use Claude Code exclusively for:
- All new features
- All debugging sessions
- All code reviews

Keep Copilot/Cursor for:
- Quick edits
- Autocomplete
```

### Measuring Success

- [ ] You instinctively reach for Claude Code for complex tasks
- [ ] You understand context management without thinking
- [ ] You've created at least 2-3 custom commands/agents
- [ ] You can estimate costs before starting a session
- [ ] You prefer Claude Code's explanations over inline docs
- [ ] You've integrated Claude Code into your daily workflow

**Productivity indicators:**

- Completing features 20-30% faster
- Spending less time debugging
- Higher code quality (caught by Claude reviews)
- Better understanding of unfamiliar code

# 2. Core Concepts

**Reading time**: 20 minutes

**Skill level**: Day 1-3

**Goal**: Understand how Claude Code thinks

## 2.1 The Interaction Loop

Every Claude Code interaction follows this pattern:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    INTERACTION LOOP                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│   1. DESCRIBE  ──→  You explain what you need           │
│        │                                                │
│        ▼                                                │
│   2. ANALYZE   ──→  Claude explores the codebas         │
│        │                                                 │
│        ▼                                                 │
│   3. PROPOSE   ──→  Claude suggests changes (diff)       │
│        │                                                 │
│        ▼                                                 │
│   4. REVIEW    ──→  You read and evaluate                │
│        │                                                 │
│        ▼                                                 │
│   5. DECIDE    ──→  Accept / Reject / Modify             │
│        │                                                 │
│        ▼                                                 │
│   6. VERIFY    ──→  Run tests, check behavior            │
│        │                                                 │
│        ▼                                                 │
│   7. COMMIT    ──→  Save changes (optional)              │
│                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Insight

The loop is designed so that **you remain in control**. Claude proposes, you decide.

## 2.2 Context Management

🔴 **This is the most important concept in Claude Code.**

### What is Context?

Context is Claude's "working memory" for your conversation. It includes:
- All messages in the conversation
- Files Claude has read
- Command outputs
- Tool results

### The Context Budget

Claude has a **200,000 token** context window. Think of it like RAM - when it fills up, things slow down or fail.

### Reading the Statusline

The statusline shows your context usage:

```
Claude Code │ Ctx(u): 45% │ Cost: $0.23 │ Session: 1h 23m
```

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Ctx(u): 45%` | You've used 45% of context |
| `Cost: $0.23` | API cost so far |
| `Session: 1h 23m` | Time elapsed |

### Context Zones

| Zone | Usage | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 🟢 Green | 0-50% | Work freely |
| 🟡 Yellow | 50-75% | Start being selective |
| 🔴 Red | 75-90% | Use `/compact` or `/clear` |
| ⚫ Critical | 90%+ | Must clear or risk errors |

### Context Recovery Strategies

When context gets high:

**Option 1: Compact** (`/compact`)
- Summarizes the conversation
- Preserves key context
- Reduces usage by ~50%

**Option 2: Clear** (`/clear`)
- Starts fresh
- Loses all context
- Use when changing topics

**Option 3: Targeted Approach**
- Be specific in queries
- Avoid "read the entire file"
- Use symbol references: "read the `calculateTotal` function"

### What Consumes Context?

| Action | Context Cost |
|--------|--------------|
| Reading a small file | Low (~500 tokens) |
| Reading a large file | High (~5K+ tokens) |
| Running commands | Medium (~1K tokens) |
| Multi-file search | High (~3K+ tokens) |
| Long conversations | Accumulates |

### Context Depletion Symptoms

Learn to recognize when context is running out:

| Symptom | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Shorter responses than usual | 🟡 Warning | Continue with caution |
| Forgetting CLAUDE.md instructions | 🟠 Serious | Document state, prepare checkpoint |
| Inconsistencies with earlier conversation | 🔴 Critical | New session needed |
| Errors on code already discussed | 🔴 Critical | New session needed |
| "I can't access that file" (when it was read) | 🔴 Critical | New session immediately |

### Context Inspection

Check your context usage in detail:

```
/context
```

Example output:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CONTEXT USAGE                                    67% used   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ System Prompt          ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  12,450 tk  │
│ System Tools           ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░   3,200 tk  │
│ MCP Tools (5 servers)  ████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  18,600 tk  │
│ Conversation           ████████████████████░░░░  89,200 tk  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TOTAL                                           123,450 tk  │
│ REMAINING                                        76,550 tk  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

💡 **The Last 20% Rule**: Reserve ~20% of context for:
- Multi-file operations at end of session
- Last-minute corrections
- Generating summary/checkpoint

### Cost Awareness & Optimization

Claude Code isn't free - you're using API credits. Understanding costs helps optimize usage.

#### Pricing Model (as of January 2025)

Claude Code uses **Claude Sonnet 3.5** by default:

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Context Window |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Sonnet 3.5** | $3.00 | $15.00 | 200K tokens |
| Opus 4 | $15.00 | $75.00 | 200K tokens |
| Haiku 3.5 | $0.80 | $4.00 | 200K tokens |

**Reality check**: A typical 1-hour session costs **$0.10 - $0.50** depending on usage patterns.

#### What Costs the Most?

| Action | Tokens Consumed | Estimated Cost |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Read a 100-line file | ~500 | $0.0015 |
| Read 10 files (1000 lines) | ~5,000 | $0.015 |
| Long conversation (20 messages) | ~30,000 | $0.090 |
| MCP tool call (Serena, Context7) | ~2,000 | $0.006 |
| Running tests (with output) | ~3,000-10,000 | $0.009-$0.030 |
| Code generation (100 lines) | ~2,000 output | $0.030 |

**The expensive operations**:
1. **Reading entire large files** - 2000+ line files add up fast
2. **Multiple MCP server calls** - Each server adds ~2K tokens overhead
3. **Long conversations without `/compact`** - Context accumulates
4. **Repeated trial and error** - Each iteration costs

#### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Strategy 1: Be specific in queries**

```bash
# ❌ Expensive - reads entire file
"Check auth.ts for issues"
# ~5K tokens if file is large

# ✅ Cheaper - targets specific location
"Check the login function in auth.ts:45-60"
# ~500 tokens
```

**Strategy 2: Use `/compact` proactively**

```bash
# Without /compact - conversation grows
Context: 10% → 30% → 50% → 70% → 90%
Cost per message increases as context grows

# With /compact at 70%
Context: 10% → 30% → 50% → 70% → [/compact] → 30% → 50%
Saves 30-40% on subsequent messages
```

**Strategy 3: Choose the right model**

```bash
# Use Haiku for simple tasks (4x cheaper input, 3.75x cheaper output)
claude --model haiku "Fix this typo in README.md"

# Use Sonnet (default) for standard work
claude "Refactor this module"

# Use Opus only for critical/complex tasks
claude --model opus "Design the entire authentication system"
```

**Strategy 4: Limit MCP servers**

```json
// ❌ Expensive - 5 MCP servers loaded
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {...},
    "context7": {...},
    "sequential": {...},
    "playwright": {...},
    "postgres": {...}
  }
}
// ~10K tokens overhead per session

// ✅ Cheaper - load only what you need
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {...}  // Only for this project
  }
}
// ~2K tokens overhead
```

**Strategy 5: Batch operations**

```bash
# ❌ Expensive - 5 separate prompts
"Read file1.ts"
"Read file2.ts"
"Read file3.ts"
"Read file4.ts"
"Read file5.ts"

# ✅ Cheaper - single batched request
"Read file1.ts, file2.ts, file3.ts, file4.ts, file5.ts and analyze them together"
# Shared context, single response
```

#### Tracking Costs

**Real-time tracking**:

The status line shows current session cost:

```
Claude Code │ Ctx(u): 45% │ Cost: $0.23 │ Session: 1h 23m
                              ↑ Current session cost
```

**Monthly tracking**:

Check your Anthropic Console for detailed usage:
- https://console.anthropic.com/settings/usage

**Cost budgeting**:

```bash
# Set a mental budget per session
- Quick task (5-10 min): $0.05-$0.10
- Feature work (1-2 hours): $0.20-$0.50
- Deep refactor (half day): $1.00-$2.00

# If you're consistently over budget:
1. Use /compact more often
2. Be more specific in queries
3. Consider using Haiku for simpler tasks
4. Reduce MCP servers
```

#### Cost vs. Value

**Don't over-optimize!**

Spending $0.50 to save 30 minutes is a **60x ROI** if your time is worth $30/hour.

| Time Saved | Cost | Your Hourly Rate | ROI |
|------------|------|------------------|-----|
| 30 min | $0.50 | $30/hr | 30x |
| 1 hour | $1.00 | $50/hr | 50x |
| 2 hours | $2.00 | $75/hr | 75x |

**When to optimize**:
- ✅ You're on a tight budget (student, hobbyist)
- ✅ High-volume usage (>4 hours/day)
- ✅ Team usage (5+ developers)

**When NOT to optimize**:
- ❌ Your time is more expensive than API costs
- ❌ You're spending more time optimizing than the savings
- ❌ Optimization hurts productivity (being too restrictive)

#### Cost-Conscious Workflows

**For solo developers on a budget:**

```markdown
1. Start with Haiku for exploration/planning
2. Switch to Sonnet for implementation
3. Use /compact aggressively (every 50-60% context)
4. Limit to 1-2 MCP servers
5. Be specific in all queries
6. Batch operations when possible

Monthly cost estimate: $5-$15 for 20-30 hours
```

**For professional developers:**

```markdown
1. Use Sonnet as default (optimal balance)
2. Use /compact when needed (70%+ context)
3. Use full MCP setup (productivity matters)
4. Don't micro-optimize queries
5. Use Opus for critical architectural decisions

Monthly cost estimate: $20-$50 for 40-80 hours
```

**For teams:**

```markdown
1. Shared MCP infrastructure (Context7, Serena)
2. Standardized CLAUDE.md to avoid repeated explanations
3. Agent library to avoid rebuilding patterns
4. CI/CD integration for automation
5. Track costs per developer in Anthropic Console

Monthly cost estimate: $50-$200 for 5-10 developers
```

#### Red Flags (Cost Waste Indicators)

| Indicator | Cause | Fix |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Sessions consistently >$1 | Not using `/compact` | Set reminder at 70% context |
| Cost per message >$0.05 | Context bloat | Start fresh `/clear` |
| >$5/day for hobby project | Over-using or inefficient queries | Review query specificity |
| Haiku failing simple tasks | Using wrong model tier | Use Sonnet for anything non-trivial |

### Context Poisoning (Bleeding)

**Definition**: When information from one task contaminates another.

**Pattern 1: Style Bleeding**
```
Task 1: "Create a blue button"
Claude: [Creates blue button]

Task 2: "Create a form"
Claude: [Creates form... with all buttons blue!]
        ↑ The "blue" bled into the new task

Solution: Use explicit boundaries
"---NEW TASK---
Create a form. Use default design system colors."
```

**Pattern 2: Instruction Contamination**
```
Instruction 1: "Always use arrow functions"
Instruction 2: "Follow project conventions" (which uses function)

Claude: [Paralyzed, alternating between styles]

Solution: Clarify priority
"In case of conflict, project conventions take precedence over my preferences."
```

**Pattern 3: Temporal Confusion**
```
Early session: "auth.ts contains login logic"
... 2h of work ...
You renamed auth.ts to authentication.ts

Claude: "I'll modify auth.ts..."
        ↑ Using outdated info

Solution: Explicit updates
"Note: auth.ts was renamed to authentication.ts"
```

**Context Hygiene Checklist**:
- [ ] New tasks = explicit markdown boundaries
- [ ] Structural changes = inform Claude explicitly
- [ ] Contradictory instructions = clarify priority
- [ ] Long session (>2h) = consider `/clear` or new session
- [ ] Erratic behavior = check with `/context`

### Sanity Check Technique

Verify that Claude has loaded your configuration correctly.

**Simple Method**:

1. Add at the top of CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
# My name is [Your Name]
# Project: [Project Name]
# Stack: [Your tech stack]
```

2. Ask Claude: "What is my name? What project am I working on?"

3. If correct → Configuration loaded properly

**Advanced: Multiple Checkpoints**
```markdown
# === CHECKPOINT 1 === Project: MyApp ===

[... 500 lines of instructions ...]

# === CHECKPOINT 2 === Stack: Next.js ===

[... 500 lines of instructions ...]

# === CHECKPOINT 3 === Owner: [Name] ===
```

Ask "What is checkpoint 2?" to verify Claude read that far.

| Failure Symptom | Probable Cause | Solution |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| Doesn't know your name | CLAUDE.md not loaded | Check file location |
| Inconsistent answers | Typo in filename | Must be `CLAUDE.md` (not `clause.md`) |
| Partial knowledge | Context exhausted | `/clear` or new session |

## 2.3 Plan Mode

Plan Mode is Claude Code's "look but don't touch" mode.

### Entering Plan Mode

```
/plan
```

Or ask Claude directly:

```
You: Let's plan this feature before implementing
```

### What Plan Mode Allows

- ✅ Reading files
- ✅ Searching the codebase
- ✅ Analyzing architecture
- ✅ Proposing approaches
- ✅ Writing to a plan file

### What Plan Mode Prevents

- ❌ Editing files
- ❌ Running commands that modify state
- ❌ Creating new files
- ❌ Making commits

### When to Use Plan Mode

| Situation | Use Plan Mode? |
|-----------|----------------|
| Exploring unfamiliar codebase | ✅ Yes |
| Investigating a bug | ✅ Yes |
| Planning a new feature | ✅ Yes |
| Fixing a typo | ❌ No |
| Quick edit to known file | ❌ No |

### Exiting Plan Mode

```
/execute
```

Or Claude will ask: "Ready to implement this plan?"

### Auto Plan Mode

**Concept**: Automatically trigger planning mode before any risky operation.

**Configuration File** (`~/.claude/auto-plan-mode.txt`):
```
Before executing ANY tool (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, WebSearch), you MUST:
1. FIRST: Use exit_plan_mode tool to present your plan
2. WAIT: For explicit user approval before proceeding
3. ONLY THEN: Execute the planned actions

Each new user request requires a fresh plan - previous approvals don't carry over.
```

**Launch with Auto Plan Mode**:

*macOS/Linux:*
```bash
# Direct
claude --append-system-prompt "Before executing ANY tool..."

# Via file (recommended)
claude --append-system-prompt "$(cat ~/.claude/auto-plan-mode.txt)"

# Alias in .zshrc/.bashrc
alias claude-safe='claude --append-system-prompt "$(cat ~/.claude/auto-plan-mode.txt)"'
```

*Windows (PowerShell):*
```powershell
# Create the config file at %USERPROFILE%\.claude\auto-plan-mode.txt with the same content

# Direct
claude --append-system-prompt "Before executing ANY tool..."

# Via file (add to $PROFILE)
function claude-safe {
    $planPrompt = Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\auto-plan-mode.txt" -Raw
    claude --append-system-prompt $planPrompt $args
}
```

**Resulting Workflow**:
```
User: "Add an email field to the User model"

Claude (Auto Plan Mode active):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 PROPOSED PLAN                                            │
│                                                             │
│ 1. Read schema.prisma to understand current model           │
│ 2. Add field email: String? @unique                         │
│ 3. Generate Prisma migration                                │
│ 4. Update TypeScript types                                  │
│ 5. Add Zod validation in routers                            │
│                                                             │
│ ⚠️ Impact: 3 files modified, 1 migration created            │
│                                                             │
│ Approve this plan? (y/n)                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

User: "y"

Claude: [Executes the plan]
```

**Result**: 76% fewer tokens with better results because the plan is validated before execution.

### OpusPlan Mode

**Concept**: Use Opus for planning (superior reasoning) and Sonnet for implementation (cost-efficient).

**Why OpusPlan?**
- **Cost optimization**: Opus tokens cost more than Sonnet
- **Best of both worlds**: Opus-quality planning + Sonnet-speed execution
- **Token savings**: Planning is typically shorter than implementation

**Activation**:
```
/model opusplan
```

Or in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{
  "model": "opusplan"
}
```

**How It Works**:
1. In **Plan Mode** (`/plan` or `Shift+Tab` twice) → Uses **Opus**
2. In **Act Mode** (normal execution) → Uses **Sonnet**
3. Automatic switching based on mode

**Recommended Workflow**:
```
1. /model opusplan        → Enable OpusPlan
2. Shift+Tab × 2          → Enter Plan Mode (Opus)
3. Describe your task     → Get Opus-quality planning
4. Shift+Tab              → Exit to Act Mode (Sonnet)
5. Execute the plan       → Sonnet implements efficiently
```

**Alternative Approach with Subagents**:

You can also control model usage per agent:

```yaml
# .claude/agents/planner.md
---
name: planner
model: opus
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
# Strategic Planning Agent
```

```yaml
# .claude/agents/implementer.md
---
name: implementer
model: haiku
tools: Write, Edit, Bash
---
# Fast Implementation Agent
```

**Pro Users Note**: OpusPlan is particularly valuable for Pro subscribers with limited Opus tokens. It lets you leverage Opus reasoning for critical planning while preserving tokens for more sessions.

## 2.4 Rewind

Rewind is Claude Code's undo mechanism.

### Using Rewind

```
/rewind
```

Or:

```
You: Undo the last change
```

### What Rewind Does

- Reverts file changes
- Restores previous state
- Works across multiple files

### Limitations

- Only works on Claude's changes (not manual edits)
- Works within the current session
- Git commits are NOT automatically reverted

### Best Practice: Checkpoint Before Risk

Before a risky operation:

```
You: Let's commit what we have before trying this experimental approach
```

This creates a git checkpoint you can always return to.

## 2.5 Mental Model

Understanding how Claude Code "thinks" makes you more effective.

### Claude's View of Your Project

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   YOUR PROJECT                          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │

│   │   - Code patterns & conventions                 │   │
│   │   - Recent changes (from git)                   │   │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Claude Knows

1. **File Structure**: Claude can navigate and search your files
2. **Code Content**: Claude can read and understand code
3. **Git State**: Claude sees branches, commits, changes
4. **Project Rules**: Claude reads CLAUDE.md for conventions

### What Claude Doesn't Know

1. **Runtime State**: Claude can't see running processes
2. **External Services**: Claude can't access your databases directly
3. **Your Intent**: Claude needs clear instructions
4. **Hidden Files**: Claude respects .gitignore by default

### Communicating Effectively

**Good prompt**:
```
The login function in src/auth/login.ts isn't validating email addresses properly.
Plus signs should be allowed but they're being rejected.
```

**Weak prompt**:
```
Login is broken
```

The more context you provide, the better Claude can help.

# 3. Memory & Settings

**Reading time**: 15 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 1
**Goal**: Customize Claude Code for your project

## 3.1 Memory Files (CLAUDE.md)

CLAUDE.md files are persistent instructions that Claude reads at the start of every session. They're called "memory" files because they give Claude long-term memory of your preferences, conventions, and project context — persisting across sessions rather than being forgotten after each conversation.

### Three Levels of Memory

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MEMORY HIERARCHY                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│   ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          (Global - All projects)  │
│        │                                                │
│        ▼                                                │
│   /project/CLAUDE.md           (Project - This repo)    │
│        │                                                │
│        ▼                                                │
│   /project/.claude/CLAUDE.md   (Local - Personal prefs) │
│                                                         │
│   Priority: Local > Project > Global                    │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Level 1: Global (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)

Personal preferences that apply to all your projects:

```markdown
# Global Claude Code Settings

## Communication Style
- Be concise in responses
- Use code examples over explanations
- Ask clarifying questions before major changes

## Preferred Tools
- Use TypeScript over JavaScript
- Prefer pnpm over npm
- Use Prettier for formatting

## Safety Rules
- Always run tests before committing
- Never force push to main
- Check for secrets before committing
```

### Level 2: Project (/project/CLAUDE.md)

Shared team conventions checked into version control:

```markdown
# Project: MyApp

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript 5.3
- PostgreSQL with Prisma
- TailwindCSS

## Code Conventions
- Use functional components
- Use `const` arrow functions
- File naming: kebab-case (my-component.tsx)

## Architecture
- API routes in /app/api
- Components in /components
- Database queries in /lib/db

## Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development
- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm lint` - Check linting
```

### Level 3: Local (/project/.claude/CLAUDE.md)

Personal overrides not committed to git (add to .gitignore):

```markdown
# My Local Preferences

## Overrides
- Skip pre-commit hooks for quick iterations
- Use verbose logging during debugging
```

### CLAUDE.md Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Keep it concise | Write essays |
| Include examples | Be vague |
| Update when conventions change | Let it go stale |
| Reference external docs | Duplicate documentation |

### Single Source of Truth Pattern

When using multiple AI tools (Claude Code, CodeRabbit, SonarQube, Copilot...), they can conflict if each has different conventions. The solution: **one source of truth for all tools**.

**Recommended structure**:

```
/docs/conventions/
├── coding-standards.md    # Style, naming, patterns
├── architecture.md        # System design decisions
├── testing.md             # Test conventions
└── anti-patterns.md       # What to avoid
```

**Then reference from everywhere**:

```markdown
# In CLAUDE.md
@docs/conventions/coding-standards.md
@docs/conventions/architecture.md
```

```yaml
# In .coderabbit.yml
knowledge_base:
  code_guidelines:
    filePatterns:
      - "docs/conventions/*.md"
```

**Why this matters**: Without a single source, your local agent might approve code that CodeRabbit then flags — wasting cycles. With aligned conventions, all tools enforce the same standards.

### What Goes Where

| Content Type | Location | Shared? |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| Team conventions | `rules/` | ✅ Commit |
| Reusable agents | `agents/` | ✅ Commit |
| Team commands | `commands/` | ✅ Commit |
| Automation hooks | `hooks/` | ✅ Commit |
| Knowledge modules | `skills/` | ✅ Commit |
| Personal preferences | `CLAUDE.md` | ❌ Gitignore |
| Personal permissions | `settings.local.json` | ❌ Gitignore |

## 3.3 Settings & Permissions

### settings.json (Team Configuration)

This file configures hooks and is committed to the repo:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/security-check.sh",
            "timeout": 5000
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/auto-format.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/git-context.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### settings.local.json (Personal Permissions)

Personal permission overrides (gitignored):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(git *)",
      "Bash(pnpm *)",
      "Bash(npm test)",
      "Edit",
      "Write",
      "WebSearch"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(rm -rf *)",
      "Bash(sudo *)"
    ],
    "ask": [
      "Bash(npm publish)",
      "Bash(git push --force)"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Permission Patterns

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `Bash(git *)` | Any git command |
| `Bash(pnpm *)` | Any pnpm command |
| `Edit` | All file edits |
| `Write` | All file writes |
| `WebSearch` | Web search capability |
| `mcp__serena__*` | All Serena MCP tools |

### Permission Behavior

| Category | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `allow` | Auto-approve without asking |
| `deny` | Block completely |
| `ask` | Prompt for confirmation |
| (default) | Use default permission mode |

### allowedTools Configuration (Alternative)

For granular control, use `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Read(*)",
    "Grep(*)",
    "Glob(*)",
    "WebFetch(*)",
    "TodoRead",
    "TodoWrite",
    "Task(*)",
    "Bash(git status:*)",
    "Bash(git diff:*)",
    "Bash(git log:*)",
    "Bash(pnpm typecheck:*)",
    "Bash(pnpm lint:*)",
    "Bash(pnpm test:*)"
  ]
}
```

**Pattern Logic**:
| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `Read(*)` | All reads | Any file |
| `Bash(git status:*)` | Specific command | `git status` allowed |
| `Bash(pnpm *:*)` | Command prefix | `pnpm test`, `pnpm build` |
| `Edit(*)` | All edits | ⚠️ Dangerous |

**Progressive Permission Levels**:

**Level 1 - Beginner (very restrictive)**:
```json
{
  "allowedTools": ["Read(*)", "Grep(*)", "Glob(*)"]
}
```

**Level 2 - Intermediate**:
```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Read(*)", "Grep(*)", "Glob(*)",
    "Bash(git:*)", "Bash(pnpm:*)",
    "TodoRead", "TodoWrite"
  ]
}
```

**Level 3 - Advanced**:
```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Read(*)", "Grep(*)", "Glob(*)", "WebFetch(*)",
    "Edit(*)", "Write(*)",
    "Bash(git:*)", "Bash(pnpm:*)", "Bash(npm:*)",
    "Task(*)", "TodoRead", "TodoWrite"
  ]
}
```

⚠️ **Never use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`**

Horror stories from r/ClaudeAI include:
- `rm -rf node_modules` followed by `rm -rf .` (path error)
- `git push --force` to main unintentionally
- `DROP TABLE users` in a poorly generated migration
- Deletion of `.env` files with credentials

**Always prefer granular `allowedTools` over disabling permissions entirely.**

### Dynamic Memory (Profile Switching)

**Concept**: Temporarily modify CLAUDE.md for specific tasks, then restore.

**Technique 1: Git Stash**
```bash
# Before modification
git stash push -m "CLAUDE.md original" CLAUDE.md

# Claude modifies CLAUDE.md for specific task
# ... work ...

# After task
git stash pop
```

**Technique 2: Profile Library**
```
~/.claude/profiles/
├── default.md          # General config
├── security-audit.md   # For security audits
├── refactoring.md      # For major refactoring
├── documentation.md    # For writing docs
└── debugging.md        # For debug sessions
```

**Profile Switch Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.local/bin/claude-profile

PROFILE=$1
cp ~/.claude/profiles/${PROFILE}.md ./CLAUDE.md
echo "Switched to profile: $PROFILE"
```

Usage:
```bash
claude-profile security-audit
claude  # Launches with security profile
```

**Technique 3: Parallel Instances**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Main project
cd ~/projects/myapp
claude  # Loads myapp's CLAUDE.md

# Terminal 2: Worktree for isolated feature
cd ~/projects/myapp-feature-x
# Different CLAUDE.md, isolated context
claude
```

## 3.4 Precedence Rules

When memory files or settings conflict, Claude Code uses this precedence:

### Settings Precedence

```
Highest Priority
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  settings.local.json             │  Personal overrides
└──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  settings.json                   │  Project settings
└──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  ~/.claude/settings.json         │  Global defaults
└──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
Lowest Priority
```

### CLAUDE.md Precedence

```
Highest Priority
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  .claude/CLAUDE.md               │  Local (personal)
└──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  /project/CLAUDE.md              │  Project (team)
└──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│  ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md             │  Global (personal)
└──────────────────────────────────┘
       │
       ▼
Lowest Priority
```

### Rules Auto-Loading

Files in `.claude/rules/` are automatically loaded and combined:

```
.claude/rules/
├── code-conventions.md    ──┐
├── git-workflow.md        ──┼──→  All loaded automatically
└── architecture.md        ──┘
```

# 4. Agents

**Reading time**: 20 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 1-2
**Goal**: Create specialized AI assistants

## 4.1 What Are Agents

Agents are specialized sub-processes that Claude can delegate tasks to.

### Why Use Agents?

| Without Agents | With Agents |
|----------------|-------------|
| One Claude doing everything | Specialized experts for each domain |
| Context gets cluttered | Each agent has focused context |
| Generic responses | Domain-specific expertise |
| Manual tool selection | Pre-configured tool access |

### Agent vs Direct Prompt

```
Direct Prompt:
You: Review this code for security issues, focusing on OWASP Top 10,
     checking for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and authentication vulnerabilities...

With Agent:
You: Use the security-reviewer agent to audit this code
```

The agent encapsulates all that expertise.

### Built-in vs Custom Agents

| Type | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Built-in | Claude Code default | Explore, Plan |
| Custom | Your `.claude/agents/` | Backend architect, Code reviewer |

## 4.2 Creating Custom Agents

Agents are markdown files in `.claude/agents/` with YAML frontmatter.

### Agent File Structure

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear activation trigger (50-100 chars)
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
skills:
  - skill-name
disallowedTools:
  - WebSearch
---

[Markdown instructions for the agent]
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Kebab-case identifier |
| `description` | ✅ | When to activate this agent |
| `model` | ❌ | `sonnet` (default), `opus`, or `haiku` |
| `tools` | ❌ | Allowed tools (comma-separated) |
| `skills` | ❌ | Skills to inherit |
| `disallowedTools` | ❌ | Tools to block |

### Model Selection

| Model | Best For | Speed | Cost |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| `haiku` | Quick tasks, simple changes | Fast | Low |
| `sonnet` | Most tasks (default) | Balanced | Medium |
| `opus` | Complex reasoning, architecture | Slow | High |

## 4.3 Agent Template

Copy this template to create your own agent:

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Use this agent when [specific trigger description]
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
skills: []
---

# Your Agent Name

## Role Definition

You are an expert in [domain]. Your responsibilities include:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

## Activation Triggers

Use this agent when:
- [Trigger 1]
- [Trigger 2]
- [Trigger 3]

## Methodology

When given a task, you should:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. [Step 4]

## Output Format

Your deliverables should include:
- [Output 1]
- [Output 2]

## Constraints

- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Scenario Name]

**User**: [Example prompt]

**Your approach**:
1. [What you do first]
2. [What you do next]
3. [Final output]
```

## 4.4 Best Practices

### Do's and Don'ts

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|-------|----------|
| Make agents specialists | Create generalist agents |
| Define clear triggers | Use vague descriptions |
| Include concrete examples | Leave activation ambiguous |
| Limit tool access | Give all tools to all agents |
| Compose via skills | Duplicate expertise |

### Specialization Over Generalization

**Good**: An agent for each concern
```
backend-architect    → API design, database, performance
security-reviewer    → OWASP, auth, encryption
test-engineer        → Test strategy, coverage, TDD
```

**Bad**: One agent for everything
```
full-stack-expert    → Does everything (poorly)
```

### Explicit Activation Triggers

**Good description**:
```yaml
description: Use when designing APIs, reviewing database schemas, or optimizing backend performance
```

**Bad description**:
```yaml
description: Backend stuff
```

### Skill Composition

Instead of duplicating knowledge:

```yaml
# security-reviewer.md
skills:
  - security-guardian  # Inherits OWASP knowledge
```

## 4.5 Agent Examples

### Example 1: Code Reviewer Agent

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use for code quality reviews, security audits, and performance analysis
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
skills:
  - security-guardian
---

# Code Reviewer

## Role Definition

You are a senior code reviewer with expertise in:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Security best practices (OWASP Top 10)
- Performance optimization
- Test coverage analysis

## Activation Triggers

Use this agent when:
- Completing a feature before PR
- Reviewing someone else's code
- Auditing security-sensitive code
- Analyzing performance bottlenecks

## Methodology

1. **Understand Context**: Read the code and understand its purpose
2. **Check Quality**: Evaluate readability, maintainability, DRY principles
3. **Security Scan**: Look for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
4. **Performance Review**: Identify potential bottlenecks
5. **Provide Feedback**: Structured report with severity levels

## Output Format

### Code Review Report

**Summary**: [1-2 sentence overview]

**Critical Issues** (Must Fix):
- [Issue with file:line reference]

**Warnings** (Should Fix):
- [Issue with file:line reference]

**Suggestions** (Nice to Have):
- [Improvement opportunity]

**Positive Notes**:
- [What was done well]
```

### Example 2: Debugger Agent

```markdown
---
name: debugger
description: Use when encountering errors, test failures, or unexpected behavior
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob
---

# Debugger

## Role Definition

You are a systematic debugger who:
- Investigates root causes, not symptoms
- Uses evidence-based debugging
- Never guesses - always verifies

## Methodology

1. **Reproduce**: Confirm the issue exists
2. **Isolate**: Narrow down to smallest reproducible case
3. **Analyze**: Read code, check logs, trace execution
4. **Hypothesize**: Form theories about the cause
5. **Test**: Verify hypothesis with minimal changes
6. **Fix**: Implement the solution
7. **Verify**: Confirm fix works and doesn't break other things

## Output Format

### Debug Report

**Issue**: [Description]
**Root Cause**: [What's actually wrong]
**Evidence**: [How you know]
**Fix**: [What to change]
**Verification**: [How to confirm it works]
```

### Example 3: Backend Architect Agent

```markdown
---
name: backend-architect
description: Use for API design, database optimization, and system architecture decisions
model: opus
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep
skills:
  - backend-patterns
---

# Backend Architect

## Role Definition

You are a senior backend architect specializing in:
- API design (REST, GraphQL, tRPC)
- Database modeling and optimization
- System scalability
- Clean architecture patterns

## Activation Triggers

Use this agent when:
- Designing new API endpoints
- Optimizing database queries
- Planning system architecture
- Refactoring backend code

## Methodology

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand the business need
2. **Architecture Review**: Check current system state
3. **Design Options**: Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
4. **Recommendation**: Suggest best approach with rationale
5. **Implementation Plan**: Break down into actionable steps

## Constraints

- Follow existing project patterns
- Prioritize backward compatibility
- Consider performance implications
- Document architectural decisions
```

## 4.6 Advanced Agent Patterns

### Tool SEO - Optimizing Agent Descriptions

The `description` field determines when Claude auto-activates your agent. Optimize it like SEO:

```yaml
# ❌ Bad description
description: Reviews code

# ✅ Good description (Tool SEO)
description: |
  Security code reviewer - use PROACTIVELY when:
  - Reviewing authentication/authorization code
  - Analyzing API endpoints
  - Checking input validation
  - Auditing data handling
  Triggers: security, auth, vulnerability, OWASP, injection
```

**Tool SEO Techniques**:
1. **"use PROACTIVELY"**: Encourages automatic activation
2. **Explicit triggers**: Keywords that trigger the agent
3. **Listed contexts**: When the agent is relevant
4. **Short nicknames**: `sec-1`, `perf-a`, `doc-gen`

### Agent Weight Classification

| Category | Tokens | Init Time | Optimal Use |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Lightweight** | <3K | <1s | Frequent tasks, workers |
| **Medium** | 10-15K | 2-3s | Analysis, reviews |
| **Heavy** | 25K+ | 5-10s | Architecture, full audits |

**Golden Rule**: A lightweight agent used 100x > A heavy agent used 10x

### The 7-Parallel-Task Method

Launch 7 specialized sub-agents in parallel for complete features:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   PARALLEL FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION                           │
│                                                             │
│   Task 1: Components     → Create React components          │
│   Task 2: Styles         → Generate Tailwind styles         │
│   Task 3: Tests          → Write unit tests                 │
│   Task 4: Types          → Define TypeScript types          │
│   Task 5: Hooks          → Create custom hooks              │
│   Task 6: Integration    → Connect with API/state           │
│   Task 7: Config         → Update configurations            │
│                                                             │
│   All in parallel → Final consolidation                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Prompt**:
```
Implement the "User Profile" feature using 7 parallel sub-agents:

1. COMPONENTS: Create UserProfile.tsx, UserAvatar.tsx, UserStats.tsx
2. STYLES: Define Tailwind classes in a styles file
3. TESTS: Write tests for each component
4. TYPES: Create types in types/user-profile.ts
5. HOOKS: Create useUserProfile and useUserStats hooks
6. INTEGRATION: Connect with existing tRPC router
7. CONFIG: Update exports and routing

Launch all agents in parallel.
```

### Split Role Sub-Agents

**Concept**: Multi-perspective analysis in parallel.

**Process**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   SPLIT ROLE ANALYSIS                                       │

│   Step 1: Setup                                             │
│   └─ Activate Plan Mode + ultrathink                        │
│                                                             │
│   Step 2: Role Suggestion                                   │
│   └─ "What expert roles would analyze this code?"           │
│      Claude suggests: Security, Performance, UX, etc.       │
│                                                             │
│   Step 3: Selection                                         │
│   └─ "Use: Security Expert, Senior Dev, Code Reviewer"      │
│                                                             │
│   Step 4: Parallel Analysis                                 │
│   ├─ Security Agent: [Vulnerability analysis]               │
│   ├─ Senior Agent: [Architecture analysis]                  │
│   └─ Reviewer Agent: [Readability analysis]                 │
│                                                             │
│   Step 5: Consolidation                                     │
│   └─ Synthesize 3 reports into recommendations              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### Parallelization Decision Matrix

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   PARALLELIZABLE?                                           │
│                                                             │

│                                                             │
│   Independent   ✅ PARALLEL           ⚠️ SEQUENTIAL        │
│                 Max efficiency         Plan Mode first      │
│                                                             │
│   Dependent     ⚠️ SEQUENTIAL         ❌ CAREFUL            │
│                 Order matters          Risk of conflicts    │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**✅ Perfectly parallelizable**:
```
"Search 8 different GitHub repos for best practices on X"
"Analyze these 5 files for vulnerabilities (without modifying)"
"Compare 4 libraries and produce a comparative report"
```

**⚠️ Sequential recommended**:
```
"Refactor these 3 files (they depend on each other)"
"Migrate DB schema then update models then update routers"
```

**❌ Needs extra care**:
```
"Modify these 10 files in parallel"
→ Risk: conflicts if files share imports/exports
→ Solution: Plan Mode → Identify dependencies → Sequence if needed
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tactical Model Selection Matrix

| Task | Model | Justification |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Read and summarize a file | Haiku | Simple, fast |
| Write a standard component | Sonnet | Good balance |
| Debug complex issue | Sonnet + ultrathink | Depth needed |
| System architecture | Opus | Maximum reasoning |
| Critical security review | Opus | High stakes |
| Generate tests | Haiku | Repetitive pattern |
| Refactor 50 files | Sonnet orchestrate + Haiku workers | Optimized cost |

**Cost Optimization Example**:
```
Scenario: Refactoring 100 files

❌ Naive approach:
- Opus for everything
- Cost: ~$50-100
- Time: 2-3h

✅ Optimized approach:
- Sonnet: Analysis and plan (1x)
- Haiku: Parallel workers (100x)
- Sonnet: Final validation (1x)
- Cost: ~$5-15
- Time: 1h (parallelized)

Savings: 80-90%
```

**Skill level**: Week 2
**Goal**: Create reusable knowledge modules

## 5.1 Understanding Skills

Skills are knowledge packages that agents can inherit.

### Skills vs Agents vs Commands

| Concept | Purpose | Invocation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Agent** | Specialized role | Task tool delegation |
| **Skill** | Knowledge module | Inherited by agents |
| **Command** | Process workflow | Slash command |

### Why Skills?

Without skills:
```
Agent A: Has security knowledge (duplicated)
Agent B: Has security knowledge (duplicated)
Agent C: Has security knowledge (duplicated)
```

With skills:
```
security-guardian skill: Single source of security knowledge
Agent A: inherits security-guardian
Agent B: inherits security-guardian
Agent C: inherits security-guardian
```

### What Makes a Good Skill?

| Good Skill | Bad Skill |
|------------|-----------|
| Reusable across agents | Single-agent specific |
| Domain-focused | Too broad |
| Contains reference material | Just instructions |
| Includes checklists | Missing verification |

## 5.2 Creating Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/` directories.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘


## Methodology

### Step 1: RED (Write Failing Test)

Write a test for the behavior you want BEFORE writing any code.

```typescript
// user.test.ts
describe('User', () => {
  it('should validate email format', () => {
    expect(isValidEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true);
    expect(isValidEmail('invalid')).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

Run: `pnpm test` → Should FAIL (function doesn't exist)

### Step 2: GREEN (Minimal Implementation)

Write the MINIMUM code to make the test pass.

```typescript
// user.ts
export const isValidEmail = (email: string): boolean => {
  return email.includes('@');
};
```

Run: `pnpm test` → Should PASS

### Step 3: REFACTOR (Improve)

Now improve the implementation while keeping tests green.

```typescript
// user.ts (improved)
export const isValidEmail = (email: string): boolean => {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
};
```

Run: `pnpm test` → Should still PASS

## Test Structure: AAA Pattern

```typescript
it('should calculate order total', () => {
  // Arrange - Set up test data
  const items = [
    { price: 10, quantity: 2 },
    { price: 5, quantity: 3 }
  ];

  // Act - Execute the code
  const total = calculateTotal(items);

  // Assert - Verify the result
  expect(total).toBe(35);
});
```

# 7. Hooks

**Reading time**: 20 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 2-3
**Goal**: Automate Claude Code with event-driven scripts

## 7.1 The Event System

Hooks are scripts that run automatically when specific events occur.

### Event Types

| Event | When It Fires | Use Case |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| `PreToolUse` | Before any tool runs | Security validation |
| `PostToolUse` | After any tool runs | Formatting, logging |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User sends a message | Context enrichment |
| `Notification` | Claude sends notification | Sound alerts |
| `SessionStart` | Session begins | Initialization |
| `SessionEnd` | Session ends | Cleanup |
| `Stop` | User interrupts | Graceful shutdown |

### Event Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      EVENT FLOW                         │

### Shell Scripts vs AI Agents: When to Use What

Not everything needs AI. Choose the right tool:

| Task Type | Best Tool | Why | Example |
|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| **Deterministic** | Bash script | Fast, predictable, no tokens | Create branch, fetch PR comments |
| **Pattern-based** | Bash + regex | Reliable for known patterns | Check for secrets, validate format |
| **Interpretation needed** | AI Agent | Judgment required | Code review, architecture decisions |
| **Context-dependent** | AI Agent | Needs understanding | "Does this match requirements?" |

**Rule of thumb**: If you can write a regex or a simple conditional for it, use a bash script. If it requires "understanding" or "judgment", use an agent.

**Example — PR workflow**:
```bash
# Deterministic (bash): create branch, push, open PR
git checkout -b feature/xyz
git push -u origin feature/xyz
gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."

# Interpretation (agent): review code quality
# → Use code-review subagent
```

**Why this matters**: Bash scripts are instant, free (no tokens), and 100% predictable. Reserve AI for tasks that genuinely need intelligence.

## 7.2 Creating Hooks

### Hook Registration (settings.json)

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": ".claude/hooks/security-check.sh",
            "timeout": 5000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `matcher` | Regex pattern for which tools trigger hook |
| `type` | Always `"command"` |
| `command` | Path to hook script |
| `timeout` | Max execution time (ms) |

### Hook Input (stdin JSON)

Hooks receive JSON on stdin:

```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "git status"
  },
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "cwd": "/project"
}
```

### Hook Output

Hooks can return JSON on stdout:

```json
{
  "systemMessage": "Message shown to Claude",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "additionalContext": "Extra information"
  }
}
```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| `0` | Success | Allow operation |
| `2` | Block | Prevent operation |
| Other | Error | Log and continue |

## 7.3 Hook Templates

### Template 1: PreToolUse (Security Blocker)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/security-blocker.sh
# Blocks dangerous commands

INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // ""')

# List of dangerous patterns
DANGEROUS_PATTERNS=(
    "rm -rf /"
    "rm -rf ~"
    "rm -rf *"
    "sudo rm"
    "git push --force origin main"
    "git push -f origin main"
    "npm publish"
    "> /dev/sda"
)

# Check if command matches any dangerous pattern
for pattern in "${DANGEROUS_PATTERNS[@]}"; do
    if [[ "$COMMAND" == *"$pattern"* ]]; then
        echo "BLOCKED: Dangerous command detected: $pattern" >&2
        exit 2
    fi
done

exit 0
```

### Template 2: PostToolUse (Auto-Formatter)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/auto-format.sh
# Auto-formats code after edits

INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')

# Only run for Edit/Write operations
if [[ "$TOOL_NAME" != "Edit" && "$TOOL_NAME" != "Write" ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Get the file path
FILE_PATH=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // ""')

# Skip if no file path
if [[ -z "$FILE_PATH" ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Run Prettier on supported files
if [[ "$FILE_PATH" =~ \.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|json|md|css|scss)$ ]]; then
    npx prettier --write "$FILE_PATH" 2>/dev/null
fi

exit 0
```

### Template 3: UserPromptSubmit (Context Enricher)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/git-context.sh
# Adds git context to every prompt

### Template 4: Notification (Sound Alerts)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/notification.sh
# Plays sounds on notifications (macOS)

INPUT=$(cat)
TITLE=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.title // ""')
BODY=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.body // ""')

# Determine sound based on content
if [[ "$TITLE" == *"error"* ]] || [[ "$BODY" == *"failed"* ]]; then
    SOUND="/System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff"
elif [[ "$TITLE" == *"complete"* ]] || [[ "$BODY" == *"success"* ]]; then
    SOUND="/System/Library/Sounds/Hero.aiff"
else
    SOUND="/System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff"
fi

# Play sound (macOS)
afplay "$SOUND" 2>/dev/null &

exit 0
```

### Windows Hook Templates

Windows users can create hooks using PowerShell (.ps1) or batch files (.cmd).

> **Note**: Windows hooks should use the full PowerShell invocation with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to avoid execution policy restrictions.

#### Template W1: PreToolUse Security Check (PowerShell)

Create `.claude/hooks/security-check.ps1`:

```powershell
# security-check.ps1
# Blocks dangerous commands

$inputJson = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd() | ConvertFrom-Json
$command = $inputJson.tool_input.command

# List of dangerous patterns
$dangerousPatterns = @(
    "rm -rf /",
    "rm -rf ~",
    "Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\",
    "git push --force origin main",
    "git push -f origin main",
    "npm publish"
)

foreach ($pattern in $dangerousPatterns) {
    if ($command -like "*$pattern*") {
        Write-Error "BLOCKED: Dangerous command detected: $pattern"
        exit 2
    }
}

exit 0
```

#### Template W2: PostToolUse Auto-Formatter (PowerShell)

Create `.claude/hooks/auto-format.ps1`:

```powershell
# auto-format.ps1
# Auto-formats code after edits

$inputJson = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd() | ConvertFrom-Json
$toolName = $inputJson.tool_name

if ($toolName -ne "Edit" -and $toolName -ne "Write") {
    exit 0
}

$filePath = $inputJson.tool_input.file_path

if (-not $filePath) {
    exit 0
}

if ($filePath -match '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|json|md|css|scss)$') {
    npx prettier --write $filePath 2>$null
}

exit 0
```

#### Template W3: Context Enricher (Batch File)

Create `.claude/hooks/git-context.cmd`:

```batch
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

for /f "tokens=*" %%i in ('git branch --show-current 2^>nul') do set BRANCH=%%i
if "%BRANCH%"=="" set BRANCH=not a git repo

for /f "tokens=*" %%i in ('git log -1 --format^="%%h %%s" 2^>nul') do set LAST_COMMIT=%%i
if "%LAST_COMMIT%"=="" set LAST_COMMIT=no commits

echo {"hookSpecificOutput":{"additionalContext":"[Git] Branch: %BRANCH% | Last: %LAST_COMMIT%"}}
exit /b 0
```

#### Template W4: Notification (Windows)

Create `.claude/hooks/notification.ps1`:

```powershell
# notification.ps1
# Shows Windows toast notifications and plays sounds

$inputJson = [Console]::In.ReadToEnd() | ConvertFrom-Json
$title = $inputJson.title
$body = $inputJson.body

# Determine sound based on content
if ($title -match "error" -or $body -match "failed") {
    [System.Media.SystemSounds]::Hand.Play()
} elseif ($title -match "complete" -or $body -match "success") {
    [System.Media.SystemSounds]::Asterisk.Play()
} else {
    [System.Media.SystemSounds]::Beep.Play()
}

# Optional: Show Windows Toast Notification (requires BurntToast module)
# Install-Module -Name BurntToast
# New-BurntToastNotification -Text $title, $body

exit 0
```

#### Windows settings.json for Hooks

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash|Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/hooks/security-check.ps1",
            "timeout": 5000
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/hooks/auto-format.ps1",
            "timeout": 10000
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 7.4 Security Hooks

Security hooks are critical for protecting your system.

### Recommended Security Rules

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/comprehensive-security.sh

INPUT=$(cat)
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // ""')

# === CRITICAL BLOCKS (Exit 2) ===

# Filesystem destruction
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ rm.*-rf.*[/~] ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: Recursive delete of root/home" >&2; exit 2; }

# Disk operations
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ ">/dev/sd" ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: Direct disk write" >&2; exit 2; }
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ "dd if=" ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: dd command" >&2; exit 2; }

# Git force operations on protected branches
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ "git push".*"-f".*"(main|master)" ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: Force push to main" >&2; exit 2; }
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ "git push --force".*"(main|master)" ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: Force push to main" >&2; exit 2; }

# Package publishing
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ "npm publish" ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: npm publish" >&2; exit 2; }

# Privileged operations
[[ "$COMMAND" =~ ^sudo ]] && { echo "BLOCKED: sudo command" >&2; exit 2; }

# === WARNINGS (Exit 0 but log) ===

[[ "$COMMAND" =~ "rm -rf" ]] && echo "WARNING: Recursive delete detected" >&2

exit 0
```

### Testing Security Hooks

Before deploying, test your hooks:

```bash
# Test with a blocked command
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"rm -rf /"}}' | .claude/hooks/security-blocker.sh
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Should be 2

# Test with a safe command
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"git status"}}' | .claude/hooks/security-blocker.sh
echo "Exit code: $?"  # Should be 0
```

## 7.5 Hook Examples

### Example 1: Activity Logger

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/activity-logger.sh
# Logs all tool usage to JSONL file

INPUT=$(cat)
LOG_DIR="$HOME/.claude/logs"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/activity-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).jsonl"

# Create log directory
mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR"

# Clean up old logs (keep 7 days)
find "$LOG_DIR" -name "activity-*.jsonl" -mtime +7 -delete

# Extract tool info
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.session_id')

# Create log entry
LOG_ENTRY=$(jq -n \
  --arg timestamp "$TIMESTAMP" \
  --arg tool "$TOOL_NAME" \
  --arg session "$SESSION_ID" \
  '{timestamp: $timestamp, tool: $tool, session: $session}')

# Append to log
echo "$LOG_ENTRY" >> "$LOG_FILE"

exit 0
```

### Example 2: Linting Gate

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .claude/hooks/lint-gate.sh
# Runs linter after code changes

INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_name')

# Only check after Edit/Write
if [[ "$TOOL_NAME" != "Edit" && "$TOOL_NAME" != "Write" ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

FILE_PATH=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // ""')

# Only lint TypeScript/JavaScript
if [[ ! "$FILE_PATH" =~ \.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$ ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Run ESLint
LINT_OUTPUT=$(npx eslint "$FILE_PATH" 2>&1)
LINT_EXIT=$?

if [[ $LINT_EXIT -ne 0 ]]; then
    cat << EOF
{
  "systemMessage": "Lint errors found in $FILE_PATH:\n$LINT_OUTPUT"
}
EOF
fi

exit 0
```

# 8. MCP Servers

**Reading time**: 15 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 2-3
**Goal**: Extend Claude Code with external tools

## 8.1 What is MCP

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources.

### Why MCP?

| Without MCP | With MCP |
|-------------|----------|
| Limited to built-in tools | Extensible tool ecosystem |
| Claude guesses about external data | Claude queries real data |
| Generic code understanding | Deep semantic analysis |

### How It Works

### Serena (Semantic Code Analysis)

**Purpose**: Deep code understanding through semantic analysis, indexing, and persistent memory.

**Why Serena matters**: Claude Code has no built-in indexation (unlike Cursor). Serena fills this gap by indexing your codebase for faster, smarter searches. It also provides **session memory** — context that persists across conversations.

**Key Features**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Indexation** | Pre-indexes your codebase for efficient symbol lookup |
| **Project Memory** | Stores context in `.serena/memories/` between sessions |
| **Onboarding** | Auto-analyzes project structure on first run |

**Tools**:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `find_symbol` | Find functions, classes, methods by name |
| `get_symbols_overview` | Get file structure overview |
| `search_for_pattern` | Regex search across codebase |
| `find_referencing_symbols` | Find all usages of a symbol |
| `replace_symbol_body` | Replace function/class body |
| `write_memory` | Save context for future sessions |
| `read_memory` | Retrieve saved context |
| `list_memories` | List all stored memories |

**Session Memory Workflow**:

```
# Start of session
list_memories() → See what context exists
read_memory("auth_architecture") → Load relevant context

# During work
write_memory("api_refactor_plan", "...") → Save decisions for later

# End of session
write_memory("session_summary", "...") → Persist progress
```

**Setup**:

```bash
# Pre-index your project (recommended for large codebases)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena project index
```

**Use when**:
- Navigating large codebases (>10k lines)
- Need context to persist across sessions
- Understanding symbol relationships
- Refactoring across files

> **Source**: [Serena GitHub](https://github.com/oraios/serena)

### mgrep (Semantic Search Alternative)

**Purpose**: Natural language semantic search across code, docs, PDFs, and images.

**Why consider mgrep**: While Serena focuses on symbol-level analysis, mgrep excels at **intent-based search** — finding code by describing what it does rather than exact patterns. Their benchmarks show ~2x fewer tokens used compared to grep-based workflows.

**Key Features**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic search** | Find code by natural language description |
| **Background indexing** | `mgrep watch` indexes respecting `.gitignore` |
| **Multi-format** | Search code, PDFs, images, text |
| **Web integration** | `--web` flag for web search fallback |

**Example**:

```bash
# Traditional grep (exact match required)
grep -r "authenticate.*user" .

# mgrep (intent-based)
mgrep "code that handles user authentication"
```

**Use when**:
- Onboarding to unfamiliar codebases
- Exploring code by intent, not exact patterns
- Searching across mixed content (code + docs)

> **Note**: I haven't tested mgrep personally. Consider it an alternative worth exploring.
> **Source**: [mgrep GitHub](https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/mgrep)

### Context7 (Documentation Lookup)

**Purpose**: Access official library documentation.

**Tools**:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `resolve-library-id` | Find library documentation |
| `query-docs` | Query specific documentation |

**Use when**:
- Learning new libraries
- Finding correct API usage
- Checking official patterns

### Sequential Thinking (Structured Reasoning)

**Purpose**: Multi-step analysis with explicit reasoning.

**Tools**:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sequentialthinking` | Step-by-step reasoning |

**Use when**:
- Complex debugging
- Architectural analysis
- System design decisions

### Postgres (Database Queries)

**Purpose**: Direct database access for queries.

**Tools**:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `query` | Execute SQL queries |

**Use when**:
- Investigating data issues
- Understanding schema
- Debugging data problems

### Playwright (Browser Automation)

**Purpose**: Browser testing and automation.

**Tools**:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `navigate` | Go to URL |
| `click` | Click element |
| `fill` | Fill form field |
| `screenshot` | Capture screenshot |

**Use when**:
- E2E testing
- Visual validation
- Browser debugging

# 9. Advanced Patterns

**Reading time**: 20 minutes
**Skill level**: Month 1+
**Goal**: Master power-user techniques

## 9.1 The Trinity

The most powerful Claude Code pattern combines three techniques:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      THE TRINITY                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                         │
│   ┌─────────────┐                                       │

│          │                                              │
│          ▼                                              │
│   ┌─────────────┐                                       │
│   │ Ultrathink  │  Deep analysis with extended thinking │
│   └──────┬──────┘                                       │
│          │                                              │
│          ▼                                              │
│   ┌─────────────────────┐                               │
│   │ Sequential Thinking │  Structured multi-step reason │
│   └─────────────────────┘                               │
│                                                         │
│   Combined: Maximum understanding before action         │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### When to Use the Trinity

| Situation | Use Trinity? |
|-----------|--------------|
| Fixing a typo | ❌ Overkill |
| Adding a feature | Maybe |
| Debugging complex issue | ✅ Yes |
| Architectural decision | ✅ Yes |
| Legacy system modernization | ✅ Yes |

### Ultrathink Levels

| Flag | Thinking Depth | Token Usage | Best For |
|------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| `--think` | Standard | ~4K | Multi-component analysis |
| `--think-hard` | Deep | ~10K | Architectural decisions |
| `--ultrathink` | Maximum | ~32K | Critical redesign |

#### Inline Thinking Keywords

You can also trigger extended thinking by adding keywords directly in your prompt:

```bash
# Minimal boost - standard analysis
claude -p "Think. Outline a plan to refactor the auth module."

# Medium boost - deeper consideration
claude -p "Think hard. Draft a migration plan from REST to gRPC."

# Strong boost - thorough analysis
claude -p "Think harder. Evaluate trade-offs for our caching strategy."

# Maximum boost - comprehensive reasoning
claude -p "Ultrathink. Propose a step-by-step strategy to fix flaky payment tests and add guardrails."
```

**How it works:**
- **think** → Claude spends more time planning before responding
- **think hard/harder** → Progressively deeper analysis with more consideration of alternatives
- **ultrathink** → Maximum pre-answer reasoning about implications, edge cases, and trade-offs

**Higher levels increase latency and token usage** - use the smallest level that works for your task.

### Example: Using the Trinity

```
You: /plan

Let's analyze this legacy authentication system before we touch anything.
Use --ultrathink to understand all the implications.

[Claude enters Plan Mode and does deep analysis]

Claude: I've analyzed the auth system. Here's what I found:
- 47 files depend on the current auth module
- 3 critical security issues
- Migration path needs 4 phases

Ready to implement?

You: /execute
Let's start with phase 1
```

## 9.2 Composition Patterns

### Multi-Agent Delegation

Launch multiple agents for different aspects:

```
You: For this feature, I need:
1. Backend architect to design the API
2. Security reviewer to audit the design
3. Test engineer to plan the tests

Run these in parallel.
```

Claude will coordinate:
- Backend architect designs API
- Security reviewer audits (in parallel)
- Test engineer plans tests (in parallel)

### Skill Stacking

Combine multiple skills for complex tasks:

```yaml
# code-reviewer.md
skills:
  - security-guardian
  - performance-patterns
  - accessibility-checker
```

The reviewer now has all three knowledge domains.

### The "Rev the Engine" Pattern

For quality work, use multiple rounds of critique:

```
You: Write the function, then critique it, then improve it.
Do this 3 times.

Round 1: [Initial implementation]
Critique: [What's wrong]
Improvement: [Better version]

Round 2: [Improved implementation]
Critique: [What's still wrong]
Improvement: [Even better version]

Round 3: [Final implementation]
Final check: [Verification]
```

### The "Stack Maximum" Pattern

For critical work, combine everything:

```
1. Plan Mode + Ultrathink → Deep exploration
2. Multiple Agents → Specialized analysis
3. Sequential Thinking → Structured reasoning
4. Rev the Engine → Iterative improvement
5. Code Review Agent → Final validation
```

## 9.3 CI/CD Integration

### Headless Mode

Run Claude Code without interactive prompts:

```bash
# Basic headless execution
claude --headless "Run the tests and report results"

# With timeout
claude --headless --timeout 300 "Build the project"

# With specific model
claude --headless --model sonnet "Analyze code quality"
```

### Git Hooks Integration

> **Windows Note**: Git hooks run in Git Bash on Windows, so the bash syntax below works. Alternatively, you can create `.cmd` or `.ps1` versions and reference them from a wrapper script.

**Pre-commit hook**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run Claude Code for commit message validation
COMMIT_MSG=$(cat "$1")
claude --headless "Is this commit message good? '$COMMIT_MSG'. Reply YES or NO with reason."
```

**Pre-push hook**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-push

# Security check before push
claude --headless "Scan staged files for secrets and security issues. Exit 1 if found."
EXIT_CODE=$?

if [ $EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Security issues found. Push blocked."
    exit 1
fi
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-review.yml

```

### Verify Gate Pattern

Before creating a PR, ensure all local checks pass. This prevents wasted CI cycles and review time.

**The pattern**:

```
Build ✓ → Lint ✓ → Test ✓ → Type-check ✓ → THEN create PR
```

**Implementation as a command** (`.claude/commands/complete-task.md`):

```markdown
# Complete Task

Run the full verification gate before creating a PR:

1. **Build**: Run `pnpm build` - must succeed
2. **Lint**: Run `pnpm lint` - must have zero errors
3. **Test**: Run `pnpm test` - all tests must pass
4. **Type-check**: Run `pnpm typecheck` - no type errors

If ANY step fails:
- Stop immediately
- Report what failed and why
- Suggest fixes
- Do NOT proceed to PR creation

If ALL steps pass:
- Create the PR with `gh pr create`
- Wait for CI with `gh pr checks --watch`
- If CI fails, fetch feedback and auto-fix
- Loop until mergeable or blocked
```

**Autonomous retry loop**:

```

### Release Notes Generation

Automate release notes and changelog generation using Claude Code.

**Why automate release notes?**
- Consistent format across releases
- Captures technical details from commits
- Translates technical changes to user-facing language
- Saves 30-60 minutes per release

**Pattern**: Git commits → Claude analysis → User-friendly release notes

#### Approach 1: Command-Based

Create `.claude/commands/release-notes.md`:

```markdown
# Generate Release Notes

Analyze git commits since last release and generate release notes.

## Process

1. **Get commits since last tag**:
   ```bash
   git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Read full commit details**:
   - Include commit messages
   - Include file changes
   - Include PR numbers if present

3. **Categorize changes**:
   - **✨ Features** - New functionality
   - **🐛 Bug Fixes** - Issue resolutions
   - **⚡ Performance** - Speed/efficiency improvements
   - **🔒 Security** - Security patches
   - **📝 Documentation** - Doc updates
   - **🔧 Maintenance** - Refactoring, dependencies
   - **⚠️ Breaking Changes** - API changes (highlight prominently)

4. **Generate three versions**:

   **A. CHANGELOG.md format** (technical, for developers):
   ```markdown
   ## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added
   - Feature description with PR reference

   ### Fixed
   - Bug fix description

   ### Changed
   - Breaking change with migration guide
   ```

   **B. GitHub Release Notes** (balanced, technical + context):
   ```markdown
   ## What's New

   Brief summary of the release

   ### ✨ New Features
   - User-facing feature description

   ### 🐛 Bug Fixes
   - Issue resolution description

   ### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
   - Migration instructions

   **Full Changelog**: v1.0.0...v1.1.0
   ```

   **C. User Announcement** (non-technical, benefits-focused):
   ```markdown
   We're excited to announce [Version]!

   **Highlights**:
   - What users can now do
   - How it helps them
   - When to use it

   [Link to full release notes]
   ```

5. **Output files**:
   - Prepend to `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Save to `release-notes-[version].md`
   - Copy "User Announcement" to clipboard for Slack/blog

## Verification

- Check for missed breaking changes
- Verify all PR references are valid
- Ensure migration guides are clear
```

#### Approach 2: CI/CD Automation

Add to `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for changelog

      - name: Generate Release Notes
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          # Get version from tag
          VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}

          # Generate with Claude
          claude --headless "Generate release notes for $VERSION. \
            Analyze commits since last tag. \
            Output in GitHub Release format. \
            Save to release-notes.md"

          # Create GitHub Release
          gh release create $VERSION \
            --title "Release $VERSION" \
            --notes-file release-notes.md

      - name: Update CHANGELOG.md
        run: |
          # Prepend to CHANGELOG
          cat release-notes.md CHANGELOG.md > CHANGELOG.tmp
          mv CHANGELOG.tmp CHANGELOG.md

          # Commit back
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add CHANGELOG.md
          git commit -m "docs: update changelog for $VERSION"
          git push
```

#### Approach 3: Interactive Workflow

For more control, use an interactive session:

```bash
# 1. Start Claude Code
claude

# 2. Request release notes
You: "Generate release notes for v2.0.0"

# 3. Claude will:
# - Run git log to get commits
# - Ask clarifying questions:
#   - "Is this a major/minor/patch release?"
#   - "Any breaking changes users should know?"
#   - "Target audience for announcement?"

# 4. Review and refine
You: "Add more detail to the authentication feature"

# 5. Finalize
You: "Save these notes and update CHANGELOG.md"
```

#### Best Practices

**Before generation:**
- ✅ Ensure commits follow conventional commits format
- ✅ All PRs have been merged
- ✅ Version number decided (semver)

**During generation:**
- ✅ Review for accuracy (Claude might miss context)
- ✅ Add migration guides for breaking changes
- ✅ Include upgrade instructions if needed

**After generation:**
- ✅ Cross-reference with closed issues/PRs
- ✅ Test upgrade path on a staging project
- ✅ Share draft with team before publishing

#### Example Output

Given these commits:
```
feat: add user avatar upload (PR #123)
fix: resolve login timeout issue (PR #124)
perf: optimize database queries by 40% (PR #125)
BREAKING: change API endpoint from /api/v1 to /v2 (PR #126)
```

Claude generates:

**CHANGELOG.md** (technical):
```markdown

```

#### Common Issues

**"Release notes are too technical"**
- Solution: Specify audience in prompt: "Generate for non-technical users"

**"Claude missed a breaking change"**
- Solution: Explicitly list breaking changes in prompt
- Better: Use "BREAKING:" prefix in commit messages

**"Generated notes are generic"**
- Solution: Provide more context: "This release focuses on mobile performance"

**"Commits are messy/unclear"**
- Solution: Clean up commit history before generation (interactive rebase)
- Better: Enforce commit message format with git hooks

## 9.4 IDE Integration

### VS Code Integration

Claude Code integrates with VS Code:

1. **Install Extension**: Search "Claude Code" in Extensions
2. **Configure**: Set API key in settings
3. **Use**:
   - `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Claude Code: Start Session"
   - Select text → Right-click → "Ask Claude"

### JetBrains Integration

```bash
# Add to .bashrc or .zshrc
alias cc='claude'
alias ccp='claude --plan'
alias cce='claude --execute'

# Quick code question
cq() {
    claude --headless "$*"
}
```

Usage:
```bash
cq "What does this regex do: ^[a-z]+$"
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Add to $PROFILE (run: notepad $PROFILE to edit)
function cc { claude $args }
function ccp { claude --plan $args }
function cce { claude --execute $args }

function cq {
    param([Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments)]$question)
    claude --headless ($question -join ' ')
}
```

To find your profile location: `echo $PROFILE`

Common locations:
- `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
- `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

If the file doesn't exist, create it:
```powershell
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force
```

## 9.5 Tight Feedback Loops

**Reading time**: 5 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 1+

Tight feedback loops accelerate learning and catch issues early. Design your workflow to validate changes immediately.

### The Feedback Loop Pyramid

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   Deploy    │  ← Hours/Days
                    │   Tests     │
                    ├─────────────┤
                    │    CI/CD    │  ← Minutes
                    │   Pipeline  │
                    ├─────────────┤
                    │   Local     │  ← Seconds
                    │   Tests     │
                    ├─────────────┤
                    │  TypeCheck  │  ← Immediate
                    │    Lint     │
                    └─────────────┘
```

### Implementing Tight Loops

#### Level 1: Immediate (IDE/Editor)
```bash
# Watch mode for instant feedback
pnpm tsc --watch
pnpm lint --watch
```

#### Level 2: On-Save (Git Hooks)
```bash
# Pre-commit hook
#!/bin/bash
pnpm lint-staged && pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

#### Level 3: On-Commit (CI)
```yaml
# GitHub Action for PR checks
- run: pnpm lint && pnpm tsc && pnpm test
```

### Claude Code Integration

Use hooks for automatic validation:

```json
// settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": ["./scripts/validate.sh"]
    }]
  }
}
```

**validate.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run after every file change
FILE=$(echo "$TOOL_INPUT" | jq -r '.file_path // .file')
if [[ "$FILE" == *.ts || "$FILE" == *.tsx ]]; then
    npx tsc --noEmit "$FILE" 2>&1 | head -5
fi
```

### Feedback Loop Checklist

| Loop | Trigger | Response Time | What It Catches |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Lint | On type | <1s | Style, imports |
| TypeCheck | On save | 1-3s | Type errors |
| Unit tests | On save | 5-15s | Logic errors |
| Integration | On commit | 1-5min | API contracts |
| E2E | On PR | 5-15min | User flows |

💡 **Tip**: Faster loops catch more bugs. Invest in making your test suite fast.

## 9.6 Todo as Instruction Mirrors

**Reading time**: 5 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 1+

TodoWrite isn't just tracking—it's an instruction mechanism. Well-crafted todos guide Claude's execution.

### The Mirror Principle

What you write as a todo becomes Claude's instruction:

```
❌ Vague Todo → Vague Execution
"Fix the bug"

✅ Specific Todo → Precise Execution
"Fix null pointer in getUserById when user not found - return null instead of throwing"
```

### Todo as Specification

```markdown
## Effective Todo Pattern

- [ ] **What**: Create user validation function
- [ ] **Where**: src/lib/validation.ts
- [ ] **How**: Use Zod schema with email, password rules
- [ ] **Verify**: Test with edge cases (empty, invalid format)
```

### Todo Granularity Guide

| Task Complexity | Todo Granularity | Example |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| Simple fix | 1-2 todos | "Fix typo in header component" |
| Feature | 3-5 todos | Auth flow steps |
| Epic | 10+ todos | Full feature with tests |

### Instruction Embedding

Embed constraints directly in todos:

```markdown
## Bad
- [ ] Add error handling

## Good
- [ ] Add error handling: try/catch around API calls,
      log errors with context, return user-friendly messages,
      use existing ErrorBoundary component
```

### Todo Templates

**Bug Fix:**
```markdown
- [ ] Reproduce: [steps to reproduce]
- [ ] Root cause: [investigation findings]
- [ ] Fix: [specific change needed]
- [ ] Verify: [test command or manual check]
```

**Feature:**
```markdown
- [ ] Design: [what components/functions needed]
- [ ] Implement: [core logic]
- [ ] Tests: [test coverage expectations]
- [ ] Docs: [if public API]
```

## 9.7 Output Styles

**Reading time**: 5 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 1+

Control how Claude responds to match your workflow preferences.

### Output Style Spectrum

```
← Minimal                                      Verbose →

### Style Directives

Add to CLAUDE.md or prompt:

**Minimal (Expert Mode):**
```markdown
Output code only. No explanations unless asked.
Assume I understand the codebase.
```

**Balanced:**
```markdown
Explain significant decisions. Comment complex logic.
Skip obvious explanations.
```

**Verbose (Learning Mode):**
```markdown
Explain each step. Include alternatives considered.
Link to documentation for concepts used.
```

### Context-Aware Styles

```markdown
## In CLAUDE.md

### Output Preferences
- **Code reviews**: Detailed, cite specific lines
- **Bug fixes**: Minimal, show diff only

**For code:**
```markdown
Format code output as:
- Full file with changes marked: // CHANGED
- Diff format for reviews
- Inline for small changes
```

**For explanations:**
```markdown
Explain using:
- Bullet points for lists
- Tables for comparisons
- Diagrams for architecture
```

### Output Templates

**Bug Fix Output:**
```markdown
**Root Cause**: [one line]
**Fix**: [code block]
**Test**: [verification command]
```

**Feature Output:**
```markdown
**Files Changed**: [list]
**Key Decisions**: [bullet points]
**Next Steps**: [if any]
```

## 9.8 Vibe Coding & Skeleton Projects

**Reading time**: 5 minutes
**Skill level**: Month 1

### Vibe Coding

"Vibe Coding" is rapid prototyping through natural conversation—exploring ideas before committing to implementation.

#### When to Vibe Code

- **Early exploration**: Testing if an approach works
- **Proof of concept**: Quick validation before full implementation
- **Learning**: Understanding a new library or pattern

#### Vibe Coding Session

```markdown
User: Let's explore how we could add real-time updates to the dashboard.
      Don't write code yet, just brainstorm approaches.

Claude: Here are three approaches we could consider:

1. **WebSockets**: Full duplex, lowest latency
   - Pro: Real-time push
   - Con: Connection management complexity

2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: One-way server push
   - Pro: Simple, native browser support
   - Con: One direction only

3. **Polling**: Periodic HTTP requests
   - Pro: Simplest implementation
   - Con: Not truly real-time, more server load

User: Let's vibe on option 2. Show me a minimal SSE setup.

Claude: [Provides minimal example for exploration]
```

#### Vibe Coding Rules

1. **No production code**: This is exploration only
2. **Throw away freely**: No attachment to vibe code
3. **Focus on learning**: Understand the approach
4. **Signal clearly**: "This is vibe code, not for production"

### Skeleton Projects

Skeleton projects are minimal, working templates that establish patterns before full implementation.

#### Skeleton Structure

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts           # Entry point (working)
│   ├── config.ts          # Config structure (minimal)
│   ├── types.ts           # Core types (defined)
│   └── features/
│       └── example/       # One working example
│           ├── route.ts
│           ├── service.ts
│           └── repo.ts
├── tests/
│   └── example.test.ts    # One working test
└── package.json           # Dependencies defined
```

#### Skeleton Principles

1. **It must run**: `pnpm dev` works from day 1
2. **One complete vertical**: Full stack for one feature
3. **Patterns, not features**: Shows HOW, not WHAT
4. **Minimal dependencies**: Only what's needed

#### Creating a Skeleton

```markdown
User: Create a skeleton for our new microservice. Include:
      - Express setup
      - One complete route (health check)
      - Database connection pattern
      - Test setup
      - Docker configuration

Claude: [Creates minimal, working skeleton with these elements]
```

#### Skeleton Expansion

```
Skeleton (Day 1)     →    MVP (Week 1)    →    Full (Month 1)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1 route              →    5 routes        →    20 routes
1 test               →    20 tests        →    100+ tests
Basic config         →    Env-based       →    Full config
Local DB             →    Docker DB       →    Production DB
```

## 9.9 Batch Operations Pattern

**Reading time**: 5 minutes
**Skill level**: Week 1+

Batch operations improve efficiency and reduce context usage when making similar changes across files.

### When to Batch

| Scenario | Batch? | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Same change in 5+ files | ✅ Yes | Efficiency |
| Related changes in 3 files | ✅ Yes | Coherence |
| Unrelated fixes | ❌ No | Risk of errors |
| Complex refactoring | ⚠️ Maybe | Depends on pattern |

### Batch Patterns

#### 1. Import Updates
```markdown
User: Update all files in src/components to use the new Button import:
      - Old: import { Button } from "~/ui/button"
      - New: import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"
```

#### 2. API Migration
```markdown
User: Migrate all API calls from v1 to v2:
      - Change: /api/v1/* → /api/v2/*
      - Update response handling for new format
      - Files: src/services/*.ts
```

#### 3. Pattern Application
```markdown
User: Add error boundaries to all page components:
      - Wrap each page export with ErrorBoundary
      - Use consistent error fallback
      - Files: src/pages/**/*.tsx
```

### Batch Execution Strategy

```
1. Identify scope   → List all affected files
2. Define pattern   → Exact change needed
3. Create template  → One example implementation
4. Batch apply      → Apply to all files
5. Verify all       → Run tests, typecheck
```

### Batch with Claude

```markdown
## Effective Batch Request

"Apply this change pattern to all matching files:

**Pattern**: Add 'use client' directive to components using hooks
**Scope**: src/components/**/*.tsx
**Rule**: If file contains useState, useEffect, or useContext
**Change**: Add 'use client' as first line

List affected files first, then make changes."

## 9.10 Continuous Improvement Mindset

The goal isn't just to use AI for coding — it's to **continuously improve the workflow** so AI produces better results with less intervention.

### The Key Question

After every manual intervention, ask yourself:

> "How can I improve the process so this error or manual fix can be avoided next time?"

### Improvement Pipeline

```
Error or manual intervention detected
        │
        ▼
Can a linting rule catch it?
        │
    YES ─┴─ NO
     │      │
     ▼      ▼
Add lint   Can it go in conventions/docs?
rule            │
            YES ─┴─ NO
             │      │
             ▼      ▼
        Add to    Accept as
      CLAUDE.md   edge case
       or ADRs
```

### Practical Examples

| Problem | Solution | Where to Add |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Agent forgets to run tests | Add to workflow command | `.claude/commands/complete-task.md` |
| Code review catches style issue | Add ESLint rule | `.eslintrc.js` |
| Same architecture mistake repeated | Document decision | `docs/conventions/architecture.md` |
| Agent uses wrong import pattern | Add example | `CLAUDE.md` |

### The Mindset Shift

Traditional: *"I write code, AI helps"*

AI-native: *"I improve the workflow and context so AI writes better code"*

> "Software engineering might be more workflow + context engineering."
> — Nick Tune

This is the meta-skill: instead of fixing code, **fix the system that produces the code**.

## 10.3 Configuration Reference

### CLAUDE.md Locations

| Location | Scope | Committed |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | All projects | N/A |
| `/project/CLAUDE.md` | This project | ✅ Yes |
| `/project/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal | ❌ No |

### Settings Files

| File | Purpose | Committed |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `settings.json` | Hook configuration | ✅ Yes |
| `settings.local.json` | Permission overrides | ❌ No |

### Permission Patterns

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `Bash(git *)` | Any git command |
| `Bash(npm test)` | Exactly npm test |
| `Edit` | All file edits |
| `Write` | All file writes |
| `WebSearch` | Web search |
| `mcp__serena__*` | All Serena tools |

## 10.4 Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "Context too long" | Used 100% context | `/clear` or `/compact` |
| Slow responses | High context usage | `/compact` |
| "Permission denied" | Security settings | Check `settings.local.json` |
| Hook not running | Registration error | Check `settings.json` matcher |
| MCP tool not found | Server not running | Check `mcp.json` config |
| Agent not found | File naming | Check `.claude/agents/` |
| Command not found | Path error | Check `.claude/commands/` |

### Context Recovery

| Context Level | Recommended Action |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 0-50% | Continue normally |
| 50-75% | Be more specific in queries |
| 75-90% | Use `/compact` |
| 90%+ | Use `/clear` |

### Common Errors

**"Tool execution failed"**
- Check tool permissions in `settings.local.json`
- Verify command syntax
- Check for missing dependencies

**"Agent not available"**
- Verify agent file exists in `.claude/agents/`
- Check YAML frontmatter syntax
- Restart Claude Code session

**"Hook blocked operation"**
- Check hook exit code (2 = blocked)
- Review hook error message
- Adjust hook rules if needed

### MCP Server Issues

**"MCP server connection failed"**

Common causes and solutions:

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ECONNREFUSED` | Server not running | Check `mcp.json` command is correct |
| `Timeout after 30s` | Slow initialization | Increase timeout or check server logs |
| `Module not found` | Missing dependencies | Run `npm install` in server directory |
| `Permission denied` | File access | Check file permissions on server executable |

**Serena MCP specific issues:**

```bash
# Index not found
serena list-memories
# If empty, re-index:
# In your project, ask Claude: "Index this project with Serena"

# Session not persisting
# Check mcp.json has correct data directory:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serena": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@serenaai/serena-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "SERENA_DATA_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/.serena"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Context7 MCP issues:**

```bash
# Documentation not found
# Ensure you're searching for official libraries:
# ✅ "React useState documentation"
# ❌ "my-custom-lib documentation" (not in Context7)

# Slow lookups
# Context7 fetches from official docs - network dependent
# Check your internet connection
```

**Sequential Thinking MCP issues:**

```bash
# "Sequential not responding"
# Sequential uses significant compute - expect 10-30s responses
# Not an error, just be patient

# Quality seems off
# Sequential works best with specific, well-defined problems
# ✅ "Debug why user authentication fails on mobile"
# ❌ "Make the app better"
```

### Permission Issues

**Pattern matching problems:**

```json
// ❌ Wrong - too specific
{
  "allowedTools": ["Bash(npm test)"]
}
// This ONLY allows exactly "npm test"

// ✅ Right - use wildcards
{
  "allowedTools": ["Bash(npm *)"]
}
// This allows any npm command
```

**Common permission patterns:**

```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Bash(git *)",           // All git commands
    "Bash(npm *)",           // All npm commands
    "Bash(pytest *)",        // All pytest commands
    "Edit",                  // All file edits
    "Write",                 // All file writes
    "Read",                  // All file reads
    "mcp__serena__*",        // All Serena tools
    "mcp__context7__*",      // All Context7 tools
    "Task"                   // Allow agent delegation
  ]
}
```

### Timeout Issues

**Claude stops responding mid-task:**

Possible causes:

1. **Network interruption** - Check your internet connection
2. **API rate limit** - Wait 1-2 minutes and retry
3. **Context exhausted** - Use `/compact` or `/clear`
4. **Long-running operation** - Some MCP operations take 30s+

**Workaround for long operations:**

```bash
# Instead of:
"Analyze all 500 files in the codebase"

# Break into chunks:
"Analyze files in /src/components/ first"
"Now analyze /src/utils/"
"Finally analyze /src/services/"
```

### Installation Issues

**Windows-specific problems:**

```powershell
# npm global install fails
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# PATH not updated
# Manually add to PATH:
$env:Path += ";$env:APPDATA\npm"

# Permission errors
# Check antivirus isn't blocking Node.js
```

**macOS-specific problems:**

```bash
# "Command not found" after install
# Check shell config loaded:
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# Permission denied on /usr/local
# Don't use sudo with npm
# Fix permissions:
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local

# curl install blocked
# Check firewall/VPN settings
```

**Linux-specific problems:**

```bash
# npm not found
# Install Node.js first:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Global install permission issues
# Configure npm to use home directory:
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Task-Specific Checklists

#### Bug Fix Checklist
```
□ Reproduce the bug (confirm it exists)
□ Identify root cause (not just symptoms)
□ Write failing test (captures the bug)
□ Implement fix
□ Verify test passes
□ Check for regressions
□ Update documentation if needed
□ Commit with descriptive message
```

#### Feature Implementation Checklist
```
□ Requirements clear? (Ask if not)
□ Design approach documented
□ Break into small tasks (TodoWrite)
□ Implement core functionality first
□ Add tests alongside code
□ Handle error cases
□ Update types/interfaces
□ Run full test suite
□ Code review (self or peer)
□ Documentation updated
```

#### Code Review Checklist
```
□ Code compiles without errors
□ Tests pass (new and existing)
□ No security vulnerabilities
□ Performance implications considered
□ Error handling adequate
□ Code style consistent
□ No commented-out code
□ No debug statements left
□ Documentation updated
```

#### Refactoring Checklist
```
□ Tests exist before refactoring
□ All tests pass before starting
□ Small, incremental changes
□ Run tests after each change
□ No behavior changes (unless intended)
□ Remove dead code
□ Update imports and references
□ Final test run passes
```

### Prompt Quality Checklist

Use this before sending complex requests:

```
□ WHAT: Clear deliverable described?
□ WHERE: File paths/locations specified?
□ HOW: Constraints/approach mentioned?
□ WHY: Context for decision-making?
□ VERIFY: Success criteria defined?
```

**Example applying checklist:**

```
❌ Vague: "Add user authentication"

✅ Complete:
"Add JWT authentication to the /api/login endpoint.
- WHERE: src/api/auth/login.ts
- HOW: Use jsonwebtoken library (already in deps),
       bcrypt for password comparison
- CONSTRAINTS: Token expires in 24h, include userId and role
- VERIFY: Test with wrong password, expired token, invalid token"
```

## A.10 Emergency Hotfix Checklist

When you need to fix production issues quickly and safely.

### Pre-Hotfix Phase (2-5 minutes)

```markdown
## Emergency Hotfix Protocol

**Incident**: [Brief description]
**Impact**: [User/system impact]
**Priority**: 🔴 Critical / 🟠 High / 🟡 Medium

### Step 1: Assess & Isolate
□ Verify the issue is reproducible
□ Check error logs/monitoring for root cause indicators
□ Estimate blast radius (how many users affected)
□ Create incident channel/ticket

### Step 2: Environment Setup
□ Create hotfix branch: `git checkout -b hotfix/[issue-name]`
□ Pull latest production: `git pull origin main`
□ Verify local environment matches production
□ Document current state (git commit hash, deployment time)

### Step 3: Context Preparation
□ Open Claude Code in project root
□ Set explicit scope: "Working on hotfix for [issue]"
□ Use Plan Mode first: `/plan` (safer for critical changes)
□ Load relevant error logs/stack traces
```

### Hotfix Development (5-15 minutes)

```markdown
### Step 4: Fix Implementation
□ Use Claude to locate issue: "Find where [error] occurs"
□ Review proposed fix carefully (critical code path)
□ Prefer minimal changes (smaller diff = lower risk)
□ Add defensive checks if time permits

### Step 5: Immediate Verification
□ Run affected test suite: `npm test [related tests]`
□ Manual smoke test of fixed functionality
□ Test edge cases that triggered the issue
□ Verify no regression in related features
```

### Post-Fix Phase (5-10 minutes)

```markdown
### Step 6: Commit & Deploy
□ Create focused commit: `git add [changed files]`
□ Write clear commit message:
   "hotfix: [verb] [what was broken]

   - Root cause: [brief explanation]
   - Fix: [what changed]
   - Tested: [how verified]

   Fixes #[incident-number]"

□ Push hotfix branch: `git push origin hotfix/[issue-name]`
□ Create PR with "HOTFIX" label
□ Tag reviewer(s) for immediate review
□ Include before/after behavior in PR description

### Step 7: Deploy & Monitor
□ Deploy to staging first if possible (even for hotfixes)
□ Monitor staging for 2-3 minutes
□ Deploy to production
□ Watch error rates/logs for 5-10 minutes
□ Verify issue is resolved in production
□ Update incident channel/ticket

### Step 8: Post-Mortem (Schedule later)
□ Document root cause analysis
□ Identify why this wasn't caught earlier
□ Add tests/monitoring to prevent recurrence
□ Update CLAUDE.md with lessons learned
□ Schedule team discussion if systemic issue
```

### Hotfix Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| Skip tests "to save time" | Run at minimum the affected tests |
| Make "while we're here" improvements | Fix ONLY the immediate issue |
| Deploy without code review | Get at least one approval (async if urgent) |
| Forget to monitor after deploy | Watch for 10+ minutes post-deploy |
| Skip documentation | Update incident log immediately |
| Work on main branch | Always use hotfix branch |

### Time-Based Decision Matrix

| Time Available | Approach |
|----------------|----------|
| **< 5 min** | Rollback to previous version, fix properly later |
| **5-15 min** | Minimal fix, comprehensive testing later |
| **15-30 min** | Proper fix with tests, still monitor closely |
| **> 30 min** | Not a hotfix, follow normal development process |

### Claude Code Hotfix Commands

```markdown
# Use Plan Mode for safety
/plan

# Ask Claude to assess
"Analyze this error log and suggest the safest minimal fix"

# Get focused context
"Read only the [affected module], not the entire codebase"

# Verify fix
"What are the potential side effects of this change?"

# Generate tests
"Create a test that would have caught this bug"
```

### Communication Template

```markdown
## Hotfix Status Update

**Status**: [In Progress / Deployed / Monitoring]
**Issue**: [One-line description]
**Fix**: [One-line solution]
**ETA**: [Timeframe]
**Risk**: Low/Medium/High
**Monitoring**: [What we're watching]

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] [Action 1]
- [ ] [Action 2]
```

## A.11 Git Archaeology Pattern

Use Claude Code to understand legacy code through git history analysis.

### Why Git Archaeology?

Understanding **why** code exists is often more valuable than understanding **what** it does.

| Question | Traditional Approach | Git Archaeology Approach |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Why this weird workaround? | Guess or ask someone | Check commit that added it |
| Why was this refactored? | Search Slack/docs | Read PR description |
| When did this bug appear? | Binary search testing | `git bisect` with Claude |
| Who knows this code? | Check Slack or guess | See commit authors |

### Pattern 1: Understanding Mysterious Code

**Scenario**: You found confusing code and want to know why it exists.

```markdown
# Step 1: Find the commit
You: "Run git blame on [file:line] to find when this code was added"

# Step 2: Get commit context
You: "Show me the full commit with git show [commit-hash]"

# Step 3: Find related discussion
You: "Search for the PR or issue related to this commit"

# Step 4: Summarize
You: "Explain why this code exists based on the commit history"
```

**Example**:

```
You: Why does user.ts:45 have this strange null check?

Claude: Let me investigate...
- Runs: git blame src/user.ts
- Finds commit: abc123 "fix: handle legacy user objects"
- Reads commit message: "Older user records don't have email field"
- Conclusion: It's a backward compatibility fix from 2023 migration
```

### Pattern 2: Tracking Feature Evolution

**Scenario**: Understand how a feature evolved over time.

```markdown
# Get all commits related to a feature
You: "Find all commits that mention 'authentication' in the last 6 months"

Claude runs:
git log --grep="authentication" --since="6 months ago" --oneline

# Analyze the evolution
You: "Summarize how authentication changed over these commits"

Claude provides timeline:
- Jan: Initial OAuth implementation
- Feb: Added 2FA support
- Mar: Migrated to JWT
- Apr: Added session refresh
```

### Pattern 3: Finding When Bugs Were Introduced

**Scenario**: A bug exists now but didn't before. Find when it appeared.

```markdown
# Manual approach
You: "Help me use git bisect to find when [bug] was introduced"

Claude guides you:
1. git bisect start
2. git bisect bad [current commit]
3. git bisect good [known good commit]
4. Claude tests each bisect step
5. Identifies the breaking commit

# Automated with Claude
You: "Write a script to test if [bug] exists, then use git bisect run"

Claude creates:
- Test script that exits 0 (good) or 1 (bad)
- Runs git bisect automatically
- Reports the exact commit that introduced the bug
```

### Pattern 4: Finding Domain Experts

**Scenario**: Who should review this code?

```markdown
You: "Who has worked on [file/directory] most?"

Claude runs:
git shortlog -sn -- [path]

Result:
42  Alice Johnson
18  Bob Smith
5   Carol White

Interpretation: Alice is the domain expert
```

### Pattern 5: Understanding Deleted Code

**Scenario**: Code was deleted but you want to understand what it did.

```markdown
# Find when code was deleted
You: "Search git history for when [function name] was removed"

Claude runs:
git log -c -S'[function name]' --all

# Restore and analyze
You: "Show me what [function name] did before it was deleted"

Claude:
1. Finds the deletion commit
2. Shows commit^ (before deletion)
3. Extracts and explains the old implementation
4. Explains why it was removed (from commit message)
```

### Pattern 6: Comparing Implementations

**Scenario**: The code changed drastically. Why?

```markdown
You: "Compare how [feature] was implemented in:
- Current version
- Version from 6 months ago"

Claude:
1. git show HEAD:[file]
2. git show HEAD~6mo:[file]
3. Highlights key differences
4. Explains evolution reasoning from commit messages
```

### Claude-Optimized Git Commands

```bash
# Most useful for archaeology

# Find commits by content
git log -S'[search term]' --oneline

# Find commits by message
git log --grep='[pattern]' --oneline

# See file history with diffs
git log -p [file]

# Who wrote which lines
git blame [file]

# Find when a file was deleted
git log --all --full-history -- [file]

# See commit with context
git show [commit-hash]

# List all files changed in commit
git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r [commit]

# See commits that touched a line range
git log -L [start],[end]:[file]
```

### Archaeology Prompt Template

```markdown
## Git Archaeology Request

**Goal**: [Understand why X exists / Find when Y broke / Find expert for Z]

**Starting Point**:
- File: [path]
- Line: [line number or function name]
- Current behavior: [what you see]

**Questions**:
1. When was this code introduced?
2. Why was it introduced (commit message, PR discussion)?
3. Has it changed since? If so, why?
4. Who are the authors/experts?

**Output Needed**:
- Timeline of changes
- Original intent (from commits/PRs)
- Current maintainers
```

### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Understanding a Workaround**

```
Developer: "Why is there a setTimeout() in the login flow?"

Claude investigates:
- git blame → Commit in 2022 by Bob
- git show [commit] → "fix: wait for analytics to load"
- Finds related issue #543 → "Login fails if analytics blocked"
- Conclusion: It's a workaround for a race condition

Recommendation: "This may be obsolete if we're using modern analytics now"
```

**Example 2: Finding Breaking Change**

```
Developer: "Tests started failing sometime this week"

Claude runs:
- git bisect with test suite
- Identifies commit: "refactor: simplify validation logic"
- git show [commit] → Changed how empty strings are validated
- Fix: Update tests to match new validation behavior
```

**Example 3: Removing Dead Code**

```
Developer: "Can we delete this old Payment class?"

Claude checks:
- git log → Last modified 2 years ago
- git grep "Payment" → No references found
- git log --grep="Payment" → See migration commit "Moved to Stripe API"
- Conclusion: Safe to delete, no longer used
```

### Archaeology Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| Ignore commit messages | Read full context with `git show` |
| Assume old code is wrong | Understand the constraints that led to it |
| Delete code without checking history | Verify why it was added before removing |
| Skip checking for related PRs | Search for issue numbers in commits |

### Nick Tune: Coding Agent Development Workflows

**Article**: [Coding Agent Development Workflows](https://medium.com/nick-tune-tech-strategy-blog/coding-agent-development-workflows-af52e6f912aa) by Nick Tune

Nick Tune's article explores a more **autonomous, pipeline-driven approach** to AI-assisted development. His workflow aims for fully autonomous task completion: the agent starts from a ticket and delivers a mergeable PR with minimal human intervention.

**Key concepts from his approach**:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Task Completion Pipeline** | Orchestrated flow: local checks → code review → PR → CI → auto-fix → loop until mergeable |
| **Single Source of Truth** | All conventions in `/docs/`, referenced by every tool (Claude, CodeRabbit, SonarQube) |
| **Shell vs AI Decision** | Deterministic tasks = bash scripts; interpretation needed = AI agents |
| **Verify Gate** | Build/lint/test must pass locally BEFORE PR creation |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Every manual intervention = opportunity to improve the workflow |

**His approach vs this guide**:

| Aspect | This Guide | Nick Tune's Approach |
|--------|------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Learning Claude Code comprehensively | Optimizing autonomous workflows |
| **Audience** | Beginners to advanced | Advanced practitioners |
| **Philosophy** | Master the tool, then customize | Automate aggressively from day one |
| **Workflow** | Interactive, human-in-the-loop | Autonomous, human-at-the-end |
| **Tooling** | Claude Code-centric | Multi-tool orchestration (CodeRabbit, SonarQube, GitHub GraphQL) |

**When to adopt his patterns**:

- You're comfortable with Claude Code basics
- You want near-autonomous PR generation
- You have CI/CD infrastructure (GitHub Actions, CodeRabbit, etc.)
- You're working on a project where you can invest in workflow setup

**Recommended reading order**:
1. This guide (master fundamentals)
2. Nick Tune's article (advanced automation)
