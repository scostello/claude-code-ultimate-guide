## About This Guide

This guide is the result of **several months of daily practice and research** with Claude Code. I don't claim to be an "expert" — I'm simply sharing what I've learned along the way, humbly hoping to help my peers and evangelize good practices in AI-assisted development.

A significant source of inspiration for this work was [Claudelog.com](https://claudelog.com/), which I highly recommend for anyone wanting to go deeper.

**Important note**: This guide was largely generated with the help of AI. As such, it likely contains errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. I would be delighted to receive any feedback, corrections, or — even better — pull requests to improve it. Don't hesitate to [open an issue](../../issues) or submit a PR!

**Language**: I wrote this guide in English by default to reach a wider audience, but French is my native language. I could easily translate it to French myself, or leverage AI and community contributions for other languages. Let me know if translations would be useful!

If you find value in this guide, have questions, or want to discuss Claude Code practices, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bruniaux-43408b83/).

# Install Claude Code (all platforms)

### The 7 Commands You Need

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show all commands |
| `/status` | Check context usage |
| `/compact` | Compress context (>70%) |
| `/clear` | Fresh start |
| `/plan` | Safe read-only mode |
| `/rewind` | Undo changes |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel operation |

### Context Management (Critical!)

| Context % | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-50% | Work freely |
| 50-70% | Be selective |
| 70-90% | `/compact` now |
| 90%+ | `/clear` required |

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Always review diffs** before accepting changes
2. **Use `/compact`** before context gets critical (>70%)
3. **Be specific** in requests (WHAT, WHERE, HOW, VERIFY)
4. **Start with Plan Mode** for complex/risky tasks
5. **Create CLAUDE.md** for every project

## Who Is This For?

- **Beginners**: Start with Quick Start (15 min) → be productive immediately
- **Intermediate**: Deep dive into Configuration, Agents, Skills
- **Power Users**: Advanced Patterns, MCP orchestration, CI/CD integration
