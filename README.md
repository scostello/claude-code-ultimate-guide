## About This Guide

### Our Pedagogical Approach

Unlike reference manuals that simply list features, **this guide follows a learning journey** designed to take you from beginner to power user. We focus on:

- **Understanding why** before diving into how
- **Real-world patterns** you can use immediately
- **Progressive complexity** — start simple, master advanced techniques at your pace
- **Practical workflows** over theoretical concepts

Think of this as your **mentor for mastering Claude Code** — not just documentation.

### Origins & Philosophy

This guide is the result of **several months of daily practice and research** with Claude Code, Anthropic's AI coding assistant CLI. Whether you're exploring agentic development, LLM-powered coding workflows, or AI pair programming, this resource covers everything from basic setup to advanced MCP server orchestration.

I don't claim to be an "expert" — I'm simply sharing what I've learned along the way, humbly hoping to help my peers and evangelize good practices in AI-assisted development.

**Key inspirations for this work:**
- [Claudelog.com](https://claudelog.com/) — Excellent tips, patterns & tutorials (highly recommended)
- [zebbern/claude-code-guide](https://github.com/zebbern/claude-code-guide) — Comprehensive reference & troubleshooting guide with cybersecurity focus
- [ykdojo/claude-code-tips](https://github.com/ykdojo/claude-code-tips) — Practical tips & productivity techniques from Y.K. Dojo

**Important note**: This guide was largely generated with the help of AI. As such, it likely contains errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. I would be delighted to receive any feedback, corrections, or — even better — pull requests to improve it. Don't hesitate to [open an issue](../../issues) or submit a PR!

> **⚠️ WINDOWS USERS - IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**
>
> I work on macOS and **have not personally tested Windows-specific commands** (PowerShell, batch files, path syntax).
>
> **What this means for you:**
> - PowerShell scripts are AI-generated and may need adjustment
> - Path separators (`\` vs `/`) may be incorrect in some examples
> - Batch file hooks may require debugging
> - Git Bash commands should work as-is (they use Unix syntax)
>
> **How you can help:**
> 1. [Open an issue](../../issues) if you find Windows-specific problems
> 2. Submit a PR with corrections (Windows testers highly appreciated!)
> 3. Join our [community discussions](../../discussions) to share Windows-specific tips
>
> **Status**: We are actively seeking Windows contributors to improve platform support.

**Language**: I wrote this guide in English by default to reach a wider audience, but French is my native language. I could easily translate it to French myself, or leverage AI and community contributions for other languages. Let me know if translations would be useful!

### The 7 Commands You Need

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/help` | Show all commands |
| `/status` | Check context usage |
| `/compact` | Compress context (>70%) |
| `/clear` | Fresh start |
| `/plan` | Safe read-only mode |
| `/rewind` | Undo changes |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel operation |

### Context Management (Critical!)

| Context % | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-50% | Work freely |
| 50-70% | Be selective |
| 70-90% | `/compact` now |
| 90%+ | `/clear` required |

---

## The Golden Rules

1. **Always review diffs** before accepting changes
2. **Use `/compact`** before context gets critical (>70%)
3. **Be specific** in requests (WHAT, WHERE, HOW, VERIFY)
4. **Start with Plan Mode** for complex/risky tasks
5. **Create CLAUDE.md** for every project
