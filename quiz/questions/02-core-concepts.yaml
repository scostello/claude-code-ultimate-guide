    question: "At what context percentage should you use /compact?"
    options:
      a: "0-50%"
      b: "50-70%"
      c: "70-90%"
      d: "Only at 100%"
    correct: "c"
    explanation: |
      Use /compact when context reaches 70-90% (the red zone). The context zones are: Green (0-50%) - work freely; Yellow (50-75%) - start being selective; Red (75-90%) - use /compact; Critical (90%+) - must /clear or risk errors. Using /compact at 70% reduces usage by approximately 50% while preserving key context.

    question: "What is Claude's context window size?"
    options:
      a: "50,000 tokens"
      b: "100,000 tokens"
      c: "200,000 tokens"
      d: "500,000 tokens"
    correct: "c"
    explanation: |
      Claude has a 200,000 token context window. Think of it like RAM - when it fills up, things slow down or fail. This context includes all messages, files read, command outputs, and tool results. Effective context management is described as "the most important concept in Claude Code."

    question: "What does the statusline 'Ctx(u): 45%' indicate?"
    options:
      a: "45% of your budget is remaining"
      b: "You've used 45% of your context"
      c: "45% of files are loaded"
      d: "Claude is 45% confident"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      The statusline metric 'Ctx(u): 45%' shows you've used 45% of your context window. The full statusline format is: `Claude Code | Ctx(u): 45% | Cost: $0.23 | Session: 1h 23m`. Monitoring this helps you know when to use /compact or /clear before context-related issues occur.

    question: "What is the difference between /compact and /clear?"
    options:
      a: "/compact is faster, /clear is more thorough"
      b: "/compact summarizes context (preserves key info), /clear starts completely fresh (loses all context)"
      c: "/compact clears files, /clear clears conversations"
      d: "They do the same thing"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      /compact summarizes the conversation, preserving key context while reducing usage by approximately 50%. Use it when running low on context. /clear starts completely fresh, losing all context - use it when changing topics or context is severely bloated. Choose based on whether you need to maintain continuity.

    question: "Which action consumes the MOST context tokens?"
    options:
      a: "Reading a small file (~500 tokens)"
      b: "Running a simple command (~1K tokens)"
      c: "Reading a large file or multi-file search (~5K+ tokens)"
      d: "Sending a short message"
    correct: "c"
    explanation: |
      Reading large files (5K+ tokens) and multi-file searches (3K+ tokens) consume the most context. A small file costs ~500 tokens, running commands ~1K tokens. Long conversations accumulate over time. To optimize, be specific in queries, use symbol references like "read the calculateTotal function" instead of entire files.

    question: "What is the 'Last 20% Rule' in context management?"
    options:
      a: "Always keep the last 20% of your conversation"
      b: "Reserve ~20% of context for multi-file operations, corrections, and summary generation at session end"
      c: "Delete 20% of context regularly"
      d: "Use only 20% of available context"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      The Last 20% Rule recommends reserving approximately 20% of your context for: multi-file operations at end of session, last-minute corrections, and generating summary/checkpoint documents. This buffer ensures you can complete your work properly even as context fills up.

    question: "What is 'context poisoning' (also called context bleeding)?"
    options:
      a: "When context usage reaches 100%"
      b: "When information from one task contaminates another"
      c: "When Claude forgets your instructions"
      d: "When files get corrupted"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      Context poisoning occurs when information from one task contaminates another. Examples include: style bleeding (blue button style applies to unrelated forms), instruction contamination (conflicting rules cause confusion), and temporal confusion (Claude uses outdated file names). Use explicit task boundaries and clarify priorities to prevent it.

    question: "What is the 7-step interaction loop in Claude Code?"
    options:
      a: "Plan, Code, Test, Deploy, Monitor, Fix, Repeat"
      b: "Describe, Analyze, Propose, Review, Decide, Verify, Commit"
      c: "Read, Write, Edit, Run, Debug, Test, Push"
      d: "Ask, Wait, Accept, Run, Check, Fix, Done"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      The interaction loop is: 1) DESCRIBE - explain what you need, 2) ANALYZE - Claude explores the codebase, 3) PROPOSE - Claude suggests changes (diff), 4) REVIEW - you read and evaluate, 5) DECIDE - Accept/Reject/Modify, 6) VERIFY - run tests, check behavior, 7) COMMIT - save changes (optional). The key insight: you remain in control throughout.

    question: "How do you exit Plan Mode to start making changes?"
    options:
      a: "/edit"
      b: "/execute"
      c: "/start"
      d: "/exit-plan"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      Use /execute to exit Plan Mode and begin implementing changes. While in Plan Mode, Claude can only read and analyze - no modifications are allowed. You can also respond to Claude's prompt "Ready to implement this plan?" to transition. This staged approach ensures you understand the plan before execution.

    question: "What is OpusPlan mode?"
    options:
      a: "A premium subscription tier"
      b: "Using Opus for planning (superior reasoning) and Sonnet for implementation (cost-efficient)"
      c: "A debugging mode"
      d: "A way to plan without Claude"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      OpusPlan uses Opus for planning (with superior reasoning capabilities) and automatically switches to Sonnet for implementation (more cost-efficient). Enable with `/model opusplan`. This provides Opus-quality planning while preserving tokens through Sonnet-speed execution. Particularly valuable for Pro subscribers with limited Opus tokens.

    question: "What are symptoms of context depletion?"
    options:
      a: "Claude types slower"
      b: "Shorter responses, forgetting CLAUDE.md instructions, inconsistencies with earlier conversation"
      c: "Error messages appear"
      d: "Cost increases dramatically"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      Context depletion symptoms include: shorter responses than usual (warning), forgetting CLAUDE.md instructions (serious), inconsistencies with earlier conversation (critical), errors on code already discussed (critical), and "I can't access that file" for files already read (critical). When critical symptoms appear, start a new session immediately.

    question: "What can /rewind do?"
    options:
      a: "Undo git commits"
      b: "Revert Claude's file changes within the current session"
      c: "Go back in conversation history"
      d: "Restore deleted files from disk"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      /rewind reverts file changes made by Claude. It works across multiple files but only on Claude's changes (not manual edits), only within the current session, and does NOT automatically revert git commits. For risky operations, create a git checkpoint first: "Let's commit what we have before trying this experimental approach."

    question: "What does Claude NOT have access to regarding your project?"
    options:
      a: "File structure and code content"
      b: "Git state and branches"
      c: "Runtime state, external services, and hidden files"
      d: "Project rules in CLAUDE.md"
    correct: "c"
    explanation: |
      Claude knows: file structure, code content, git state, and project rules (CLAUDE.md). Claude does NOT know: runtime state (can't see running processes), external services (can't access databases directly), your intent (needs clear instructions), and hidden files (respects .gitignore by default). Understanding this mental model helps you communicate effectively.

    question: "What is the purpose of the 'Sanity Check Technique'?"
    options:
      a: "To verify code compiles correctly"
      b: "To verify Claude has loaded your CLAUDE.md configuration correctly"
      c: "To check for memory leaks"
      d: "To validate test coverage"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      The Sanity Check Technique verifies Claude loaded your configuration. Add identifiable info to CLAUDE.md (like your name, project name, tech stack), then ask Claude "What is my name? What project am I working on?" Correct answers confirm configuration is loaded. For advanced checking, add multiple checkpoints throughout long CLAUDE.md files.

    question: "When should you use XML-structured prompts?"
    options:
      a: "For all prompts regardless of complexity"
      b: "For multi-step features, bug investigations with context, and code reviews with specific criteria"
      c: "Only for simple one-liner requests"
      d: "Only when working with APIs"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      Use XML-structured prompts when requests have 3+ distinct aspects (instruction + context + constraints), when ambiguity causes misunderstanding, when creating reusable templates, or for complex hierarchy. Don't use them for simple one-liner requests or quick typo fixes - the overhead outweighs the benefit. Tags like <instruction>, <context>, <constraints> help Claude understand different aspects.

    question: "What is a 'Session Handoff Pattern' used for?"
    options:

      b: "Documenting state, decisions, and next steps to maintain continuity between sessions"
      c: "Backing up your code"
      d: "Exporting conversation history"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      The Session Handoff Pattern creates a document to bridge gaps between sessions. It includes: what was accomplished, current state, decisions made, next steps, and context for the next session. Create handoffs at end of work day, before context limit, when switching focus areas, or during interruptions. Store in `claudedocs/handoffs/handoff-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

    question: "What is the typical cost of a 1-hour Claude Code session?"
    options:
      a: "$0.01 - $0.05"

      c: "$1.00 - $5.00"
      d: "$10.00 - $20.00"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      A typical 1-hour session costs $0.10 - $0.50 depending on usage patterns. The guide provides cost budgets: quick task (5-10 min) $0.05-$0.10, feature work (1-2 hours) $0.20-$0.50, deep refactor (half day) $1.00-$2.00. Spending $0.50 to save 30 minutes provides 60x ROI if your time is worth $30/hour - don't over-optimize!

    question: "What is Auto Plan Mode and how do you enable it?"
    options:
      a: "Automatic planning that's always on by default"
      b: "A configuration that forces Claude to present a plan and wait for approval before any tool execution"
      c: "A mode that automatically generates project plans"
      d: "A premium feature for enterprise users"
    correct: "b"
    explanation: |
      Auto Plan Mode makes Claude present a plan and wait for explicit user approval before executing ANY tool. Configure via `~/.claude/auto-plan-mode.txt` and launch with `claude --append-system-prompt "$(cat ~/.claude/auto-plan-mode.txt)"`. Results in 76% fewer tokens with better results because plans are validated before execution.
