    question: "What is the recommended action when context usage reaches 70%?"
    options:
      a: "Continue working normally"
      b: "Use /compact to compress context"
      c: "Use /clear to reset completely"
      d: "Exit and restart Claude Code"
    correct: "b"           # a | b | c | d
    explanation: |
      At 70% context usage (orange zone), you should use /compact to summarize
      the conversation and free up space while preserving key context.

      /clear is a more drastic option that completely resets context, which
      is typically only needed at 90%+ usage (red/critical zone).

      The context zones are:
      - 0-50%: Green (work freely)
      - 50-70%: Yellow (be selective)
      - 70-90%: Orange (/compact now)
      - 90%+: Red (/clear required)
