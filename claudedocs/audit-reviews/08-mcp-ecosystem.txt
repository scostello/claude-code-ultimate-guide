ISSUE: Q08-019 - [critical] CORRECT_ANSWER - The explanation states "There is no configurable 'auto:N' parameter" yet the question claims auto:N controls lazy loading. The guide (architecture.md:996) shows ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=auto:N sets thresholds (5%/10%/20% context), NOT max tools. The 10,000 token threshold is automatic. The question confuses threshold configuration with tool count.
